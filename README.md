## Project for COMM3130 _Computational Text Analysis for Communication Research_ (Fall 2024)

## Crisis Communication: How Has It Changed Since the 1980s?

Our project examines how crisis communication strategies have changed over time since the famous Johnson and Johnson Tylenol recall of the 1980s. Our aim with this project was to examine whether or not these communication strategies may have been influenced since this critical point in brand management, given how the J&J response has now been cemented as a gold standard in this realm. This project was also an exercise in NLP techniques and understanding their implementations.

Our focus was on one thousand articles covering various drug-recall related cases and examining the change within the pharmaceutical industry specifically, in order to isolate the effect of communication strategies since the J&J recall (a drug-specific case). There were two parts to the analysis, the first consisting of basic text analysis of a corpus (of 200 cases) developed for each decade (with the following dimensions: frequency lists, Context using KWIC functions, and Sentiment analysis implementing the VADER algorithm); the second part consisted of primarily comparative analysis, including keyness analysis for certain word/phrase usage based on what the most popular results were for the frequency lists, as well as simply written parts synthesizing the main themes and findings from KWIC analysis & Sentiment analysis (for the sake of organizing overall thoughts on the similarities/differences between each decade corpus). We then compiled all of these findings within a blog post highlighting the various findings and overall themes found.
