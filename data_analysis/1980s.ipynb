      "Warner-Lambert Co. Monday suspended worldwide sales of an arthritis drug linked to five deaths and scattered cases of severe skin reaction in Europe, a spokesman said.\n",
      "The New Jersey-based pharmaceutical company said it is recalling Isoxicam, a non-steroidal drug designed to reduce the inflammation of joints due to arthritis.\n",
      "The drug was introduced in Europe in 1983, but company spokesman Marshall Molloy said it has not been released in the United States. It has been under review by the federal Food and Drug Administration since 1982.\n",
      "The company decided to voluntarily withdraw the anti-arthritis drug from the world market so it can be re-evaluated scientifically and medically, Malloy said. He said the drug already had been recalled in France.\n",
      "Malloy said 13 cases of a rare but severe skin disorder called Lyelle's syndrome have been linked to Isoxicam. The syndrome, which causes inflammation and sometimes loss of the skin, caused four deaths in France and one in Italy.\n",
      "''Our clinical research (before the drug was released) had not shown reactions of this severity,'' Malloy said. He said the company did 300 clinical tests involving 46,000 people before the drug was introduced in 1983.\n",
      "Malloy said the drug has been prescribed about 6.5 million times for roughly 4 million patients. He said sales of Isoxicam in 1984 totalled more than $20 million and were projected to reach nearly $25 million for 1985.\n",
      "The first death linked to Isoxicam occurred in August 1984 in France. The drug was also marketed in West Germany, Italy, Switzerland, Austria, Belgium, Pakistan, Thailand, the Phillipines, Malazia-Singapore, Peru, Chile, and parts of the Middle East and Central America.\n",
      "''We continue to believe in both the safety and efficacy of Isoxicam,'' the chief executive officer of Warner-Lambert, Joseph Williams, said in a statement. ''But in the current climate, we recognize that the responsible and prudent thing to do is to subject the drug to increased scrutiny and to suspend the sales while that review is in progress.''\n",
      "The suspension will allow ''sufficient time for the company to show various European Economic Community members that the data bases they are using are erroneous and incomplete, at least with respect to adverse reaction reports relating to competitive products that Isoxican is being compared to,'' Malloy said.\n",
      "Warner-Lambert is a worldwide health and personal care products company with sales of about $3.2 billion.\n",

The drug was also marketed in West Germany, Italy, Switzerland, Austria, Belgium, Pakistan, Thailand, the Phillipines, Malazia-Singapore, Peru, Chile, and parts of the Middle East and Central America.\\n''We continue to believe in both the safety and efficacy of Isoxicam,'' the chief executive officer of Warner-Lambert, Joseph Williams, said in a statement. ''But in the current climate, we recognize that the responsible and prudent thing to do is to subject the drug to increased scrutiny and to suspend the sales while that review is in progress.''\\nThe suspension will allow ''sufficient time for the company to show various European Economic Community members that the data bases they are using are erroneous and incomplete, at least with respect to adverse reaction reports relating to competitive products that Isoxican is being compared to,'' Malloy said.\\nWarner-Lambert is a worldwide health and personal care products company with sales of about $3.2 billion.\\n\\n\\u2028\\n\\n\",\n",

Lacey, closed a case in which the FDA asserted it had the right to test generic drugs before they were distributed.\\nPremo said its less expensive products were identical to drugs made by major companies on which patents had expired.\\nBut the judge found differences in inactive ingredients and manufacturing processes were great enough to allow the FDA to test the products, a process which can take up to 10 years.\\nThe varying inactive ingredients could cause the generic product to dissolve in the bloodstream at a different rate than the brand-name products, Lacey decided.\\nThe government contended many doctors and patients believed the products were equivalent.\\nIn the case of one drug, triamterene with hydrochlorothiazide, an error could possibly be fatal to the patient, the judge decided.\\nLacey issued a preliminary injunction Feb. 3 barring the manufacture or sale of eight of Premo\\'s drugs.\\nOne of those drugs, betamethasone valerate cream, used for skin ailments, was not subject to the recall.\\nPremo\\'s triamterene product also was not subject to recall, but Walsh said the FDA believed it was no longer on the marketplace.\\n\"We didn\\'t feel there was any out there,\" he said.\\nPremo argued in a separate suit that long delays by the FDA in testing new drug applications deprived the public of low-cost drugs. It asked the FDA be forced to decide new drug applications within 180 days.\\nBut Premo dropped the suit under the settlement, although it may be filed again within a year.\\nThe recalled drugs, with brand names and their manufacturers are: allopurinol tablets, marketed as Zyloprim by Burroughs Wellcome for treating gout symptoms; chlorthalidone tablets, marketed as Hygroton by USV Pharmaceuticals for treating edema; trifluoperazine hydrochloride tablets, marketed as Stelazine by Smith Kline & French for treating psychosis; doxylamine succinate and pyridoxine hydrochloride tablets, marketed as Bendectin by Merrell-National Laboratories for morning sickness; hydroxyzine pamoate capsules, or Vistaril, and hydroxyzine hydrochloride tablets, or Atarax, both by Pfizer Pharmaceuticals for tension.\\n\\n\\u2028\\n\\n']"
