    "* this analysis focuses on the normalized frequencies for phrases per 10,000 words\n",
    "* Interestingly the phrase \"risk of\" increased within the news/media coverage with time\n",
    "* usage of the phrase \"heart attack\" increased with time until the 2000s, and then fell off until the 2020s; perhaps this could relate to the drugs being recalled, as in the drugs from the 1980s-2000s were more associated with heart issues/concerns\n",
    "* the phrases consumer \"trust\" and \"confidence\" were non-existent across all decades; this could be an analysis issue, or perhaps an area in which no striking information was found\n",
    "* mentions of the \"drug administration\" kept relatively steady; it tapered off a little bit going into those mid 3 decades, and then picked up back again to pre-90s levels in 2020s\n",
    "* The phrase \"he said\" also diminished significantly over time; indicative of the number of public statements-that were relevant to the issue-were made (i.e. whether it was by the head of company, a representative/etc., or a public official making a statement on behalf, and so forth)\n",
    "  * in other words, the mentions of public statements made dwindled with time"

    "* Messaging demonstrated a clear shift toward prioritizing public health and patient safety. \n",
