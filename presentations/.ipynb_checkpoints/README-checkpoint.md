  3. What are your planned analyses and/or any initial findings.

### Final Presentation

* The presentation should have 8-10 slides that cover:
  1. What is your research question and hypothesis?

  3. What analyses did you carry out?

There are two PDF files located within this presentation folder, one titled "Initial" Crisis Communication Strategy and another labeled with the same name tagged with the term "Final." The first presentation consisted of mostly pitch material, including the premise and basis of the idea to conduct research related to crisis communication (starting with the J&J famous recall in the 1980s as the "inspiration"). The "final" presentation goes more in depth with respect to the data collection and analysis, and built off the content from the first set of presentation slides. The final presentation slides report some overall findings and themes found across frequency and KWIC analyses. We originally anticipated synthesizing a potential set of common techniques and rhetorical themes that we could then apply in a more specific scope of analysis focusing on one or two more recent cases, but the change over time analysis (involving the 1000 articles) took longer than expected, so we decided to give reference to the case-specific dimension in the blog post as a potential for a future research area.
