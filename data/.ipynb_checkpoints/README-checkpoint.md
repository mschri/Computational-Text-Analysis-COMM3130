## Data files for COMM3130 Group Project

* This folder should contain the data files you have used in your analysis


* You should update this README file to list and describe the files.


* You can also create additional sub-folders to better organize your data.
    * For example, you could have a folder called `raw` or `orig` to contain the original data files you downloaded and then a folder called `final` or `clean` that contains versions of these data sheets that you have worked with to clean up missing data, to subset or merge etc.

Data Descriptions:

* Contained in this folder are .RTF and .txt files, containing around 200 news articles per respective decade, starting with the 1980s and going until the 2020s.

* Each set of text per decade was downloaded from Nexis Uni through the following search process:
   * Started with the search term: "drug recall" being entered into the main search bar
   * And then the following search terms/criteria were applied to narrow the search of interest:
     * Type of Search: News
     * Narrow by:
       * Timeline: narrowed by 10 year increments (i.e. for 1980s text file, listed decade would be 1980
         1989, etc.)
       * Industry: pharmaceutical & biotechnology
       * Search within results: (include) "said"-was inputted as a means of narrowing the search to news articles
         which included statements, and ideally those made by higher ups within the company)
       * Geography: North America (this was simply meant to keep searches within the American  news realm, as we noticed without this filter many articles coming from other countries i.e. China, Germany, UK, etc. would show up)
   * After the articles of interest appeared following this narrowing process, we then downloaded the searches via the following process/inputs:
     * Download: 
       * Range: 1-200 articles
       * File Type: Rich Text Format (RTF)
       * Selected:
         * Full documents
         * Group and save documents as a single file
   * Then, after obtaining the RTF files on our computers, we simply copy and pasted all of the information on the RTF file into a new .txt file
   * To reiterate, we repeated this search & download process to produce a total of 5 files (for each decade from 1980s through the 2020s), each containing 200 articles (therefore 1,000 articles total) as the basis for analysis
  * The files .RTF & .txt files within this folder titled "Files (200); example file" were simply example files meant to test this process of collection

* The purpose of analyzing these (in total) 1000+ news articles is to use the public sentiment, gather descriptions & other relevant information as a proxy measure for how effective company communication strategies were, based on the feelings with which they were received by the public (news outlets)
