Recalled drug still sold in China
United Press International
October 30, 2002 Wednesday

Despite a recent recall by the Chinese government, a controversial medication remains on the market in China, highlighting the problems officials face in attempting to reform the nation's prescription drug industry, physicians told United Press International.
Bimolane, a medicine used to treat the common skin disease psoriasis, is suspected of links to cancer. The World Health Organization prohibited its use in 1985 after studies suggested it could cause acute myelogenous leukemia, the most frequently reported form of the disease in adults.
China's State Drug Administration announced a recall and destruction of Bimolane last week, following a major nationwide campaign by physicians and health workers to recall the drug.
"We have issued the recall and are currently in the process of removing this dangerous medicine from the domestic market," a spokesman for the drug administration told UPI.
Despite the recall, Bimolane remains widely available in drug stores in Shanghai and some doctors are still prescribing the medicine -- which sells under the Chinese name "Yishuangmalin." The failure of state drug authorities to keep Bimolane off the store shelves is an example of how profit often takes priority over safety in China's prescription medicine industry, physicians said.
"Until the government recall, the medicine was widely used and over-prescribed, and the drug companies and small drug stores made large profits on its sale," said Feng Liangyu, a doctor at Shanghai's Huashan Hospital.
Feng said most of the city's hospitals stopped prescribing the medicine last year, but underground clinics and "crooked doctors" have continued to recommend it to patients.
"It's a big problem, but these doctors continue to prescribe it because it's cheap and effective," she said.
In their own studies of Bimolane, Chinese researchers found it affects the composition of human DNA and can trigger leukemia during an incubation period ranging from 3 months to 15 years.
Statistics from the Ministry of Health estimate tens of millions of people suffer from psoriasis in China and health care workers have become extremely concerned many of them may be at serious risk.
In Harbin, a city in China's northeastern province of Heilongjiang, one hospital recorded more than 170 leukemia cases related to the use of Bimolane in the past 15 years, according to a state media report.
Physicians complain the medical community in China has been warning the government about the potential side-effects of the drug for years, but said authorities have failed to take action until now.
"We've known about the links between Bimolane and Leukemia for years, and we've done our own tests here in China," one doctor, who did not wish to be identified, told UPI. "It's just government bureaucracy."
Plagued by soaring medical costs, a lack of fiscal oversight and widespread corruption in the prescription drug industry, Beijing has been waging an uphill battle to reform the nation's troubled health care system. The sheer size of China's multi-billion dollar drug market has made it difficult for central authorities to regulate it, and provincial governments tend to shelter pharmaceutical firms.
Some doctors and drug retailers even take kick-backs from pharmaceutical firms to over-prescribe unsafe and often unlicensed medicines to patients, health care workers and local government officials said.
Because of Bimolane's widespread popularity, and the increasingly profit-driven nature of China's huge prescription drug market, officials said it could take months before the drug is removed completely from the market.
A manager at a local drug store, asked why Bimolane still was being sold, said she had not been notified by authorities of the recall and was unaware of the drug's suspected links to leukemia.
"We sell a lot of that medicine, I'm surprised that we haven't heard anything from the officials," she said.

FULL TEXT
Boston Scientific Corp. voluntarily recalled about 200 units of a drug-eluting coronary stent system, citing a malfunction that can impede balloon deflation during a coronary angioplasty procedure. The company said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has received reports of one death and 16 serious injuries associated with the balloon deflation, and eight reports of balloon malfunction that were not associated with patient injury. The company said it was notifying 99 U.S. hospitals and three Canadian hospitals that received the affected stents, and should immediately discontinue their use. It said the recall does not affect patients who have already received the stent because the difficulty occurs at the time of insertion, not afterward. About 222,000 of the stents have been implanted at more than 1,300 U.S. hospitals since the stent system was launched domestically in March.

Baxter: FDA seizes recalled drug pumps

Baxter Healthcare Corp. said Thursday that the Food and Drug Administration seized infusion pumps the medical-device maker held at two facilities in Illinois after a recent recall of the products.
The company, a unit of Baxter International Inc. of Deerfield, said about 6,000 Colleague infusion pumps and 850 Syndeo syringe pumps were seized from the facilities owned by the company. Its stock fell 87 cents, or 2.3 percent, to $37.24 in late morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
The devices, which deliver controlled amounts of intravenous drugs to patients, were recalled in September after battery problems were linked to four deaths and 10 serious injuries. Baxter said it decided in July to withhold further shipments of the products after the FDA classified the recall as a Class I, the most serious type - an action taken when defective products pose a life-threatening risk.
About 250,000 Colleague pumps are in use worldwide, with more than 80 percent in the United States. Worldwide, about 5,000 Syndeo pumps are in use.
An FDA spokeswoman said Thursday she could not immediately provide more information about the seizure.
Baxter first warned customers in March of a design flaw that could disrupt infusions of intravenous therapies to patients. The company took a $65 million ([euro]54.3 million) charge in the second quarter related to the recall.
Company spokeswoman Cindy Resman on Thursday declined to say whether the FDA's action would affect third-quarter earnings, which the company is scheduled to report Oct. 20.
Baxter officials in July said the company would take at least until the end of the year to fix about 250,000 Colleague pumps already in use at hospitals worldwide. Resman said the work is continuing but declined to forecast when it might be finished.
The Colleague device had sales of about $120 million ([euro]100.2 million) during the second half of last year.
As a result of the FDA seizure, Baxter said it would be unable to provide customers with replacement pumps for devices that have been removed from service.
"We are committed to working with the agency and our customers to resolve these issues as quickly as possible," Baxter CEO Robert Parkinson Jr. said in a statement.

TORONTO - Gary Sheffield said yesterday he will stop taking the pain reliever Vioxx after the company that makes the drug recalled it recently because studies showed it can increase risk of heart attack and stroke if used for a long time.
"I saw the report, so I'll stop taking it," said Sheffield, who has been using Vioxx since June to soothe his injured left shoulder. "It isn't something I've been doing for a long time. I just started taking it this year to deal with my shoulder. People have been using it for years, so I'm not really concerned.
"You would have thought they would have known this before," Sheffield added. "To hear it now, it was sort of strange."
Sheffield said he would take Advil instead.
TORRE 'STEPS DOWN': It sounds like a shocking announcement, but it's just the kind of thing that happens when a team is playing out their schedule. Joe Torre said yesterday he won't manage for the rest of the regular season. Bench coach Willie Randolph managed last night and will do it again today and a "celebrity" manager - a Yankee player - will guide the team tomorrow. Randolph made out the lineup card last night and the only regular was Hideki Matsui, who batted in the first and was taken out. "Willie's basically going to manage the next couple of days," Torre said. "I told him I'd be his bench coach." Torre has let a player manage the team on the final day of the season for the last few years, if the game doesn't mean anything. The Yankees clinched their seventh straight AL East title Thursday, along with home field throughout the playoffs.
KEEP ACTIVE: Jason Giambi was the designated hitter last night and likely will start the final two games of the season as well, as the Yankees try to determine his postseason role. The Yanks have been talking as if Giambi might not be on the roster for the first series, but Torre indicated last night that Giambi probably would be active. "It's a longshot" that Giambi would not be on the roster, Torre said. "I watch other teams pitch to him and they're careful," Torre said. "There could be a benefit there."
STREAKY HITTER: Matsui has been batting cleanup against righties but hit second yesterday so he would bat in the first inning to keep his consecutive-games streak alive. Matsui did not go out into the field - he was replaced by Bubba Crosby in left in the bottom of the first. Matsui's streak reached 1,573 games when he grounded to second last night - 1,250 in Japan and 323 in the majors.

Baxter: FDA Seizes Recalled Drug Pumps

Shares of Baxter International Inc. slipped Thursday after the medical device maker said federal regulators have seized drug pumps the company had stopped shipping earlier this year because of a product recall.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration confiscated nearly 7,000 of the pumps from two Baxter warehouses in Illinois, the company said.
Deerfield, Ill.-based Baxter said it decided to voluntarily halt shipments of the devices in July after discovering a design flaw in the pumps, which deliver intravenous drugs to patients. Baxter has said at least two unrelated problems with its Colleague infusion pump might have resulted in seven deaths and 16 serious injuries.
Company officials said Baxter has been working to fix about 250,000 Colleague pumps in use at hospitals worldwide, although problems have surfaced in only a small number. The recall forced the company to take a $65 million charge for the second quarter.
Some of the devices seized Wednesday by the FDA were replacements for customers who had their pumps removed for service under the recall. But the majority were new pumps that Baxter had no intention of shipping until the safety issues were resolved, spokeswoman Cindy Resman said.
"We can't speculate about (the FDA's) intentions," Resman said.
An FDA spokeswoman on Thursday said the seizure was part of an ongoing investigation but declined to provide more information.
Baxter shares fell 69 cents, or 1.8 percent, to close at $37.42 on the New York Stock Exchange, near the high end of its 52-week range of $29.35 to $41.07.
Resman declined to say whether the confiscation of about 6,000 Colleague pumps and 850 Syndeo syringe pumps would affect the company financially. Baxter is scheduled to report third-quarter results Oct. 20.
"Anytime the FDA seizes stuff it's serious, but as far as a financial impact, I don't think there's anything to worry about yet," said Luke Coha, director of corporate finance and a health care industry analyst at Fitch Ratings.
Baxter officials in July said it would take at least until the end of the year to fix the 250,000 Colleague pumps already in use. The device had sales of about $120 million during the second half of last year.

"Anytime the FDA seizes stuff it's serious, but as far as a financial impact, I don't think there's anything to worry about yet," said Luke Coha, director of corporate finance and a health care industry analyst at Fitch Ratings.
Baxter officials in July said it would take at least until the end of the year to fix the 250,000 Colleague pumps already in use. The device had sales of about $120 million during the second half of last year.
As a result of the FDA seizure, Baxter said it would be unable to provide customers with replacement pumps for devices that have been removed from service.
"We are committed to working with the agency and our customers to resolve these issues as quickly as possible," Baxter CEO Robert Parkinson Jr. said in a statement.

Bayer recalls cholesterol drug

Bayer Pharmaceutical Division Wednesday recalled the cholesterol-lowering drug Baycol because of reports it can cause muscle tissue to break down and lead to death.
Baycol, a trade name of the drug cerivastatin, was initially approved in the United States in 1997. It is a member of a class of cholesterol lowering drugs that are commonly referred to as "statins," which lower cholesterol levels by blocking a specific enzyme involved in the synthesis of cholesterol.
While all statins have been associated with very rare reports of rhabdomyolysis, cases of fatal muscle reactions associated with the use of Baycol have been reported significantly more frequently than for other approved statins.
Rhabdomyolysis is a condition that results in muscle cell breakdown and release of the contents of muscle cells into the bloodstream. Symptoms of rhabdomyolysis include muscle pain, weakness, tenderness, malaise, fever, dark urine, nausea and vomiting. The pain may involve specific groups of muscles or may be generalized throughout the body.
The most frequently involved muscle groups are the calves and lower back. In rare cases the muscle injury is so severe that patients develop renal failure and other organ failure, which can be fatal.
The Food and Drug Administration said the fatal reactions were most frequently associated with higher doses of Baycol when used by elderly patients, particularly in conjunction with gemfibrozil, another lipid lowering drug.
The FDA has received reports of 31 U.S. deaths due to severe rhabdomyolysis associated with use of Baycol, 12 of which also involved gemfibrozil use.
Bayer Pharmaceutical Division plans to ask pharmacies to return the product to the manufacturer for a refund. Patients who are taking Baycol are advised to talk with their doctors about switching to alternative medications. Those experiencing muscle pain or are also taking gemfibrozil should discontinue Baycol immediately and call a doctor.
For more information, call Bayer at 800-758-9794 or the FDA at 301-827-4573 or 1-888-INFO-FDA.
Separately, Biotics Research Corp. of Rosenberg, Texas, recalled two digestive aids that may be contaminated by salmonella.
Biotics recalled three lots of Hydrozyme in bottles containing 90 and 250 tablets and one lot of HCI-Plus in 90-tablet bottles. Both products increase stomach acid for digestion in patients who have a hydrochloric acid deficiency.
The FDA said no illnesses have been associated with the digestive aids and the recall is precautionary. The contamination was picked up in routine testing by one of Biotics' suppliers, American Laboratories of Omaha, Neb.

The drugmaker ESI Lederle announced Thursday that it is recalling 4.2 million capsules of the arthritis drug etodolac because they are contaminated with another drug that could cause life-threatening problems in some patients.
The manufacturer said the recall covers one lot - number 9991052 - of 300 milligram capsules of the drug used in arthritis and pain management.
The capsules were distributed nationwide.
The company said the etodolac was contaminated during manufacture with the drug acebutolol hydrochloride, a type of drug known as a beta blocker that is used by patients with high blood pressure and certain heart problems.
This contamination may "in rare cases, cause serious or life-threatening side effects in patients with underlying heart conditions," the company said.
The etodolac is a white capsule. Capsules in the contaminated lot are marked in red with "300" on one end and "59911" over "3607" on the other end.
The company urged patients to stop taking these capsules and to contact their pharmacist or doctor.
"We encourage patients who are currently taking etodolac to take immediate action," Dr. Philip J. de Vane of Lederle said in a statement. "If the lot number cannot be determined, it should be assumed to be from that lot."
Patients can return the affected drugs to Lederle by calling 1-800-747-7016.
ESI Lederle is the generic unit of Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories and a division of American Home Products Corporation.

A pharmaceutical company issued a nationwide recall Friday of about 500 bottles of a drug used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and narcolepsy.
One lot of Methylin Chewable Tablets in 5-milligram strength may contain as much as three times the active ingredient, Alliant Pharmaceuticals said in a statement Friday evening.
The Alpharetta, Ga.-based company voluntarily recalled the drug after testing and evaluation. The company said that medication from the lot could pose serious health risk for some patients.
"We are committed to taking whatever steps are necessary to ensure the safety of all patients who use any one of our products," Alliant President Mark Pugh said in the statement. "We are confident that this matter will be resolved quickly."
No one had complained or reported adverse effects from the lot as of Friday night, the company said. Alliant estimated that fewer than 500 of the 2,820 bottles in the lot are in distribution.
The company said it is sending letters about the recall to doctors and pharmacists and is asking pharmacists to notify patients who bought the recalled drug.
The lot number is #AMT50402A and has an expiration date of April 2006. The company asked distributors and pharmacies to check lot numbers and quarantine any medicine that matches.
A spokesman for the Food and Drug Administration, Brad Stone, said the agency had been informed of the situation and was working to ensure the proper implementation of the recall.

 The U.S. Department of Health & Human Services' Food & Drug Administration issued the following press release:
  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is taking action to ensure that the public is fully aware that Able Laboratories of Cranbury, NJ, is conducting a nationwide recall of all of its manufactured drugs (mostly generic prescription drugs, including drugs containing acetaminophen) because of serious concerns that they were not produced according to quality assurance standards. Able Laboratories has ceased all current production. 
  "The FDA continues to evaluate the situation at Able Laboratories to determine the safety and quality of their products and will update the public on our findings as necessary," said Margaret O'K. Glavin, Associate Commissioner for Regulatory Affairs. "In the meantime, the Agency recommends that people who have been taking drugs produced by this firm speak with their health care provider or pharmacist to obtain a replacement drug product. Consumers should continue taking the medication until they have spoken with their health care provider. In many cases the risk of suddenly stopping needed medication before getting replacement drugs may outweigh the risk of continuing to use the recalled products." 
  The list below provides the names of the recalled drugs and their imprint codes. Imprints are marks (usually letters and numbers) found on the surfaces of drugs. If you have one of the drugs listed below with one of the corresponding imprint codes, your drug is covered by the Able Laboratories recall.
  Liquid products that are being recalled can be identified by the lot numbers printed on their packaging.
  It is important to note that this recall only applies to the drugs produced by Able Laboratories - and not to the same drugs produced by other manufacturers.
  Tables omitted (The document can be viewed at: http://www.fda.gov/bbs/topics/NEWS/2005/NEW01182.html)
  It is important to note that this recall only applies to the drugs produced by Able Laboratories - and not to the same drugs produced by other manufacturers. An investigation is underway to identify all the repackers and wholesalers who distribute these drugs from Able Laboratories. In the meantime, the best way for consumers to know whether they have a product produced by Able Laboratories is to check the list below and either contact their pharmacist or compare the imprint numbers on their individual tablets with the imprint numbers listed on the FDA website. 
  Consumers with questions may contact Able Laboratories at 1-800-982-2253. Persons wanting to report any adverse events to the FDA may contact FDA's MedWatch office at 1-800-FDA-1088.

GlaxoSmithKline recalls drug used for epilepsy, bipolar disorder

GlaxoSmithKline is recalling about 100,000 starter kits of Lamictal, used to treat epilepsy and bipolar disorder, after finding the wrong dosage in two of the kits.
The kits are designed so that patients gradually increase their dosage of the drug, lamotrigine, over several weeks.
The errant kits supplied a white 25 milligram pill rather than a pink 100 milligram pill for the fifth week, company spokeswoman Ramona DuBose said Thursday.
"Anybody that has a prescription for Lamictal does not need to worry. There's no problem with the tablets or with the bottles," DuBose said.
About 150,000 epileptics use the drug to ward off seizures and another 100,000 people use it to treat bipolar disorder.
The starter kits, distributed nationwide, are packaged by a third party, but DuBose declined to name the contractor or disclose its location.
GlaxoSmithKline is not notifying consumers of the recall but is sending notices to physicians, wholesalers, retailers and its sales force, DuBose said.
The recall follows the federal seizure last month of all doses of Paxil CR and Avandamet due to concerns about a GSK manufacturing plant in Puerto Rico.
U.S. sales of Lamictal, which is manufactured at GSK's facility in Zebulon, N.C., totaled $278 million last year. Shares of GlaxoSmithKline fell 17 cents or .37 percent on the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday, closing the day at $46.
Patients with questions about the kits should call their physician or GlaxoSmithKline at 1-888-825-5249.

Jury on recalled drug case meets

Highlight: Bayer sued for $560 million U.S. First of 8,400 cases filed
Body



A jury began deliberating yesterday in a globally watched $560 million (U.S.) lawsuit against Bayer Corp. over a cholesterol drug that was pulled from the market after being linked to dozens of deaths.
The lawsuit - brought by Hollis Haltom, an 82-year-old engineer who said a muscle-wasting disease caused by Baycol severely weakened his legs - is the first of about 8,400 cases against Bayer to go to trial.
Haltom's lawyers produced e-mails and internal documents to argue that the drug giant failed to adequately warn doctors about the possible side effects of the billion-dollar drug.
Like other plaintiffs, Haltom suffered from a disease called rhabdomyolysis after his doctor suggested he switch to Baycol.
Pittsburgh-based Bayer has acknowledged the link to rhabdomyolysis but said it acted responsibly by withdrawing the drug in 2001 after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration linked it to at least 52 deaths worldwide, including 31 in the United States.
Haltom's lawyers said that number has now grown to 100 deaths worldwide.
They asked for $58 million for suffering and $500 million in punitive damages.
In closing arguments, Bayer attorney Philip Beck acknowledged that Haltom suffered because of Baycol but said the elderly man was blaming unrelated diseases on it. A doctor hired by Bayer found Haltom has many disorders, including diabetes and vascular problems.
"He's an 82-year-old man and he's got a history of really remarkable health problems," Beck said.
Bayer also contended that Haltom's lawyers had taken snippets of e-mails and other internal documents out of context.
Baycol won FDA approval in 1997 and became the fastest-growing drug in Bayer's history.
Bayer has paid about $140 million to settle more than 500 Baycol cases. The U.S.-traded stock of German parent Bayer AG has fallen a quarter since the trial began in February.
Yesterday, parent company Bayer AG was put on review for a possible downgrade by Moody's Investors Service Ltd. over risks from the lawsuits related to the Baycol drug, Bloomberg News reported.
About $6.7 billion in debt and a commercial paper program is affected, Moody's said. It rates Bayer's debt A2, the sixth of 10 possible investment-grade debt ratings.
"We are no longer sufficiently confident that Bayer will be able to meet all outstanding litigation claims through its insurance," Moody's said.

China Launches Drug Recall System

China launched a nationwide recall system Wednesday that shifts responsibility to companies to recall harmful drugs, a day after U.S. and Chinese officials signed an agreement on the safety of medicine and medical devices.
The recall plan will place Chinese-made drugs and imported drugs in three classes according to their possible danger to people's health, a State Food and Drug Administration official said at a news conference.
Each will have to be recalled within different timeframes, ranging from 24 hours for the most serious drugs, to 72 hours for those deemed less life-threatening.
The global pharmaceutical industry increasingly uses drugs either made or containing ingredients sourced in China. That has put more attention on China to restore confidence in its manufacturing capabilities after a series of products ranging from toothpaste to pet food ingredients were found to contain poisonous products earlier in the summer.
The new recall rule puts the onus on companies to have systems in place to recall bad drugs within the set time period and take responsibility to alert the government of any noticeable bad reactions on patients that are caused by their drugs. They are also encouraged to carry out voluntary recalls and may be excused punishment if they do.
Drug distributors and medical institutes must also notify authorities of any safety risk to a particular drug.
Unlike in the U.S. where drug recalls by companies are voluntary, the Chinese government can also order a compulsory recall of bad drugs. A fine three times the total value of the recalled drugs will also be levied on a company which did not voluntarily recall a bad drug.
"We hope that government and companies can cooperate to enhance and perfect the establishment of the system and not just rely on the government's information. The companies should make efforts to monitor drug reactions," State Food and Drug Administration Deputy Director Yan Jiangying said.
The recall doesn't deal with counterfeit drugs, which are covered under a different law.
Under the agreement made with the U.S. Tuesday, the State Food and Drug Administration will require firms manufacturing specific drugs and medical devices to register with it.
The agreement covers 10 exports to the U.S., and eight products the Chinese want to import. This is just a sliver of China's health-related exports to the U.S. but the list may be expanded, Yan said.
The list for the U.S. includes drugs to treat impotence, dietary supplements, glucose test strips and condoms.
On China's list is drugs to treat AIDS, hepatitis and insulin, as well as pacemakers.

Merck recalls arthritis drug

The makers of the blockbuster arthritis drug Vioxx, taken by millions for pain and seen as a potential cancer prevention medicine, pulled it from the market Thursday after a study found it doubled the risk of heart attacks and strokes.
Medical experts advised patients to stop taking Vioxx and consult their doctors about alternatives. Merck and Co., the drug's maker, said about two million people worldwide use Vioxx, and a total of 84 million have taken it since it came on the market with great fanfare in 1999.
Health Canada, which approved Vioxx in late 1999, has not issued a regulatory recall of the drug, which was voluntarily withdrawn by Merck.
What is important for Canadians to know is if they're on this medication, they should contact their family physician, Health Canada spokeswoman Jirina Vlk said in Ottawa.
Every drug has a benefit versus a risk, so do the benefits outweigh the risks? Vlk said. Now we have new safety data that tops the balance.
So far, Vioxx has been pulled from shelves of wholesalers, pharmacies and physicians in Canada.
News of the drug's dangers came from a three-year study aimed at showing that Vioxx could prevent the recurrence of polyps, which can turn cancerous, in the colon and rectum. Merck stopped the study after discovering study participants had double the risk of a heart attack, compared to others taking dummy pills.
The company said the heart risks and other cardiovascular complications appeared 18 months after patients started taking Vioxx, which also is prescribed for acute pain and disorders such as carpal tunnel syndrome.
We're taking this action because we believe it best serves the interest of patients, Ray V. Gilmartin, Merck's chairman, president and chief executive, said in a prepared statement.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said there were early signs of potential problems with Vioxx. A Merck study led to warnings about heart risks being placed on the drug's label in 2001, and the FDA has been monitoring problems reported to it since then.
This is not a total surprise, said Dr. Steven Galson, acting director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.
The Ontario Pharmacists Association used its Drug Information and Resource Centre to get the message out to pharmacists so they can provide advice to consumers.
Pharmacists are the most accessible of all health-care providers, association CEO Marc Kealey said in a statement. We want to work with physicians, government and other health-care providers to ensure that patients are given the best advice as to how to safely deal with this development.
Officials don't know yet how the drug may be causing the increased risk of heart attack and stroke.
It could be because Vioxx seems to increase chances of developing high blood pressure more than some other drugs, said Dr. Steven Abramson, director of rheumatology at New York University Hospital for Joint Diseases.
There are very few patients for whom there won't be a good alternative drug, Abramson said.
Besides generic drugs such as ibuprofen, naproxen and ASA, those include Pfizer's blockbuster Celebrex, which Abramson said has not been linked to heart complications.
A person doesn't have to worry because they took a pill today or yesterday that they're going to have a heart attack, he added.
Vioxx's removal also will be a blow to hopes that it and other drugs known as COX-2 inhibitors could be used to prevent cancer in people at high risk of developing it. A landmark study in 2002 showed that small, daily doses of ASA could prevent colon cancer, and studies hinted that COX-2 inhibitors might do the same, possibly without ASA's side-effects.
All COX-2 inhibitors can raise blood pressure, but Vioxx appears to be the only one that's been linked to higher risk of heart attacks and strokes, said Galson.
 Graphic



 
Vioxx is arranged on a counting tray, laying on top of the bottle, at The Pennington Apothecary in Pennington, N.J., Thursday. Pharmaceutical giant Merck and Co. is halting worldwide sales of the blockbuster arthritis drug, once viewed as possibly being able to prevent some cancers, because new data from a clinical trial found an increased risk of heart attack and stroke.

Recalled drug may be linked to 52 deaths: Bayer

BERLIN - Bayer AG said Monday its Baycol anti-cholesterol drug may be linked to 52 deaths -- including one in Canada. The announcement came five days after Germany's biggest drug maker announced a voluntary recall of the drug.
The Leverkusen-based company said the deaths occurred following treatment with Baycol's active ingredient, cerivastatin. It said the chances of the drug, known as Lipobay outside Canada and the United States, ever returning to the market are "slim."
The Associated Press; The Canadian Press
"If the use of this medicine has resulted in damage to health, that is something we deeply regret," chief executive Manfred Schneider said at a news conference Monday. "We do everything we can to eliminate such risks," stressing that there is still no proof that the drug caused the deaths.
The worldwide withdrawal followed increasing reports of the drug's side effects, especially in patients who have been taking gemfibrozil, another cholesterol-lowering drug, at the same time.
"There's been one death in Canada associated with this combination," said Philip Blake, executive vice-president and general manager of Bayer Healthcare in Canada.
"It's not known whether the death was caused by the combination … the patient was taking the combination at the time of death."
Health Canada spokeswoman Roslyn Tremblay said Wednesday that in Canada up to the end of June, there were 32 reports of the side effects -- known as rhabdomyolysis -- linked to Baycol.
Rhabdomyolysis, a condition in which muscle cells are destroyed and released into the bloodstream, has many symptoms which include pain, weakness, tenderness, fever, dark urine, nausea and vomiting.
The drug was approved for use in Canada in February 1998, and 1.3 million total prescriptions have been filled for users since then.
The German Health Ministry, meanwhile, said it ordered a report from regulators into whether the drug should have been recalled earlier. The findings are to be presented Thursday.
Bayer's stock dropped by 20 per cent in three days after it announced the recall because of possible links to deaths. Schneider pledged to overhaul his pharmaceuticals strategy, sparking speculation it will seek a joint venture or sell the unit.
"We will now examine what strategy we adopt, what new targets we set ourselves, and how we achieve them -- on our own or in partnerships," he said.
Schneider said that two rival companies had approached Bayer about a partnership, but he didn't identify the companies or indicate what they proposed. The news helped Bayer's stock recover in early afternoon trading Monday.
Bayer plans to cut 5,000 jobs across the company and close 15 polymers plants by 2005 under a plan to save the equivalent of $1.9 billion Cdn and offset mounting problems at the drug unit and the impact of the slowing world economy. That's even before possible job cuts as a result of the withdrawal of Baycol.

The following recalls have been announced:
 One production lot of Hydromorphone HCl 2 milligram tablets, manufactured by KV Pharmaceutical Co., because the tablets might be oversized. ETHEX Corp., the St. Louis marketer of the drug, said taking a higher dose of the drug might increase risk of suffocation, difficulty breathing, low blood pressure and sedation. No illnesses or incidents have been reported, according to the marketer. The product is prescribed for pain management. ETHEX Corp. said other companies in the U.S. produce and market versions of Hydromorphone HCl tablets. Ethex Corp. announced recalls of several drugs earlier this year, also due to the possibility of oversized tablets. All shipments of drug products in tablet form approved by the Food and Drug Administration have been suspended so that KV Pharmaceutical can address manufacturing and quality issues, ETHEX said in a release. For more information, consumers can call 800-748-1472.

The following recalls have been announced:
 One production lot of Hydromorphone HCl 2 milligram tablets, manufactured by KV Pharmaceutical Co., because the tablets might be oversized. ETHEX Corp., the St. Louis marketer of the drug, said taking a higher dose of the drug might increase risk of suffocation, difficulty breathing, low blood pressure and sedation. No illnesses or incidents have been reported, according to the marketer. The product is prescribed for pain management. ETHEX Corp. said other companies in the U.S. produce and market versions of Hydromorphone HCl tablets. Ethex Corp. announced recalls of several drugs earlier this year, also due to the possibility of oversized tablets. All shipments of drug products in tablet form approved by the Food and Drug Administration have been suspended so that KV Pharmaceutical can address manufacturing and quality issues, ETHEX said in a release. For more information, consumers can call 800-748-1472.
 About 3,000 Newport rubbed-black 4-in-1 cribs and 6,000 matching furniture pieces manufactured in Indonesia by Munire Furniture Inc. of Piscataway, N.J. The red paint underneath the black finish has high levels of lead, which is toxic if ingested by young children. The company has received one report of a child diagnosed with lead poisoning after ingesting the paint. The recalled items were sold at specialty furniture stores around the country between April 2006 and November 2008. Details: by phone at 866-586-9639; on the Web at http://www.munirefurniture.com or            http://www.cpsc.gov.
 About 125,000 alpine ski bindings, manufactured in Austria by Atomic Skis GmbH, because the heel housing can crack and cause the binding to release unexpectedly. An additional 1 million bindings were sold internationally. The company has received four reports of injuries, including one concussion. The bindings were sold at authorized Atomic USA ski dealers around the country between 1998 and 2005.

Georgia company recalls attention deficit drug

A Georgia-based pharmaceutical company issued a nationwide recall Friday of about 500 bottles of a drug used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and narcolepsy.
One lot of Methylin Chewable Tablets in 5-milligram strength may contain as much as three times the active ingredient, Alliant Pharmaceuticals said in a statement Friday evening.
The Alpharetta, Ga.-based company voluntarily recalled the drug after testing and evaluation. The company said that medication from the lot could pose serious health risk for some patients.
"We are committed to taking whatever steps are necessary to ensure the safety of all patients who use any one of our products," Alliant President Mark Pugh said in the statement. "We are confident that this matter will be resolved quickly."
No one had complained or reported adverse effects from the lot as of Friday night, the company said. Alliant estimated that fewer than 500 of the 2,820 bottles in the lot are in distribution.
The company said it is sending letters about the recall to doctors and pharmacists and is asking pharmacists to notify patients who bought the recalled drug.
The lot number is #AMT50402A and has an expiration date of April 2006. The company asked distributors and pharmacies to check lot numbers and quarantine any medicine that matches.
A spokesman for the Food and Drug Administration, Brad Stone, said the agency had been informed of the situation and was working to ensure the proper implementation of the recall.

FDA, Bayer recall cholesterol drug

The Food and Drug Administration and Bayer Corp. on Wednesday began a worldwide recall of the cholesterol lowering drug cerivastatin, sold under the Baycol brand name, after 31 people died from a severe muscle-related side effect.
An FDA spokesman told UPI the company alerted the agency to problems with cerivastatin in December 1999. The drug is linked to rhabdomyolysis, a severe muscle reaction in which muscle cells break down and release their contents into the bloodstream. It is very painful, can cause swelling, fever, nausea and vomiting, and can be fatal.
FDA approved cerivastatin in 1997. It is a member of the class of cholesterol lowering drugs called statins that work by blocking an enzyme in the body involved in the processing of cholesterol. The agency issued a talk paper on the recall that said while statins are associated with rare reports of rhabdomyolysis, fatal cases linked to Baycol "have been reported significantly more frequently than for other approved statins." During a conference call with reporters, Bayer representatives said the fatalities occurred among patients, especially the elderly, who also were being treated with gemfibrozil, another cholesterol-lowering medication, or who had been given the highest allowable dosage of cerivastatin at the beginning of treatment.
An FDA spokesman said the agency "hasn't determined whether one is a greater problem than the other" but its written statement indicated 12 of the deaths were associated with concurrent gemfibrozil use. Mark Ryan, vice president for public policy and communications at Bayer, said the recall is worldwide, except in Japan, where gemfibrozil is not available. The FDA approved drug label changes in 1999 that made it clear cerivastatin and gemfibrozil were not to be used together and Ryan said the company tried to get the message out to physicians to initially prescribe the lowest dosage.
"In our discussion with FDA, they did tell us that they weren't surprised that some of these measures had not achieved the desired affects," Ryan said. "Label inserts are not read completely and thoroughly." Bayer has set up a patient telephone hotline for information at 800-758-9794 and also has updated its baycol.com Web site.
The company said in a statement that in light of the recall and the continuing weakness of the world economy that its earning would be substantially less and that its target of 20 percent return on sales for 2002 "can no longer be met."
There are five other statins approved by FDA as alternatives to Baycol, including Mevacor (lovastatin), Pravachol (pravastatin), Zocor (simvastatin), Lescol (fluvastatin) and Lipitor (atorvastatin).

ABLE Laboratories may not be a household name, but you'll find its generic drugs in households all over the United States.
A generic version of Tylenol with codeine, a generic version of Vicodin and a generic version of Ritalin are among the more than 40 drugs it lists as its products.
But in a matter of days, the company has spiraled downward.
"To withdraw all of your products, shut down your manufacturing plant, have your CEO take flight that day -- those are unusual occurrences," says Sharon DiStefano, an independent health care analyst who followed the company for two years.
DiStefano says ABLE Laboratories was once considered a "hot" company, reaching $100 million in sales last year. She says she was startled by what happened last week.
Thursday, the CEO resigned.
Monday, the company announced it was suspending its manufacturing operations, citing improper laboratory practices, and it initiated a recall of all its products.
Numerous calls made to ABLE Laboratories by CNN were not returned.
The Food and Drug Administration said it couldn't discuss what if any action it may be taking with ABLE Laboratories. But last year, the FDA sent a warning letter to ABLE, citing 27 reports of adverse effects of its drugs, saying ABLE did not report them.
Its recall comes at a time when the drug industry has come under scrutiny because of high profile recalls.
"This is totally different from the Vioxx and Celebrex case. This deals with how this company was manufacturing the finished product," says Kenneth Reid of FDAinfo.com.
One of ABLE's biggest products, for example, is the generic form of Vicodin -- but it is only one of 11 companies making it. ABLE is estimated to have less than 10 percent of the market share.
Reid says, "At one time, it was very difficult to tell which generic you were getting. But these days, because of labeling handed out in pharmacies, you can see the name of the company at the bottom."

Co. Recalls Arthritis Drug Etodolac

The drugmaker ESI Lederle announced Thursday that it is recalling 4.2 million capsules of the arthritis drug etodolac because they are contaminated with another drug that could cause life-threatening problems in some patients.
The manufacturer said the recall covers one lot number 9991052 of 300 milligram capsules of the drug used in arthritis and pain management. The capsules were distributed nationwide.
The company said the etodolac was contaminated during manufacture with the drug acebutolol hydrochloride, a type of drug known as a beta blocker that is used by patients with high blood pressure and certain heart problems.
This contamination may ''in rare cases, cause serious or life-threatening side effects in patients with underlying heart conditions,'' the company said.
The etodolac is a white capsule. Capsules in the contaminated lot are marked in red with ''300'' on one end and ''59911'' over ''3607'' on the other end.
The company urged patients to stop taking these capsules and to contact their pharmacist or doctor.
''We encourage patients who are currently etodolac to take immediate action,'' Dr. Philip J. de Vane of Lederle said in a statement. ''If the lot number cannot be determined, it should be assumed to be from that lot.''
Patients can return the affected drugs to Lederle by calling 1-800-747-7016.
ESI Lederle is the generic unit of Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories and a division of American Home Products Corporation.

Recalled Diabetes Drug Subject of Suits

Highlight: Two class action suits have been filed against Warner-Lambert Co over the effects of the diabetes drug Rezulin
Body




Mar. 24--A pair of class-action lawsuits was filed yesterday seeking refunds and payments for medical tests for the estimated 1.9 million Americans who took the Rezulin diabetes drug, which was recalled this week after being linked to liver failures and death.
Lawsuits have already been filed by individuals in several states who claim they were hurt by the drug. These newest lawsuits, though, appear to be the first in the nation by people who took Rezulin, but haven't suffered harm, according to lawyers who filed the cases.
"You're talking about people who have to go back to their physicians and need to be followed over a period of time," said Stephen Sheller of Sheller, Ludwig & Badey, a Philadelphia firm involved in the lawsuits.
"The problem is we don't know over what period of time they can develop a (liver) problem," he continued. "And we now know that a lot of people whose liver tests were negative developed liver problems, anyway."
One lawsuit was filed by Barbara Rowan, an East Brunswick woman, in Superior Court in Middlesex County. The other lawsuit was filed by a Florida man in Superior Court in Morris County, where the drug's manufacturer, Warner-Lambert Co., is based.
Rezulin was withdrawn earlier this week amid a blizzard of controversy over the rising number of cases of liver failures and deaths attributed to the drug. To date, 90 cases of liver failure and 63 deaths have been linked to the diabetes pill.
The withdrawal followed a series of damaging disclosures that plagued Warner-Lambert as well as the Food and Drug Administration, which approved the drug three years ago but was continually rocked by negative news reports about side-effect data.
Those reports included conflicts of interest and fudged data attributed to clinical-trial investigators safety data reported belatedly to the FDA, and the early removal of an FDA doctor who was assigned to review Rezulin after criticizing links to liver toxicity.
The revelations prompted Public Citizen, a consumer watchdog group, to call for a criminal investigation of Warner-Lambert, and members of Congress to consider hearings about the FDA's handling of the drug, which was given a six-month priority review in 1997.
Wall Street, however, has taken the drug recall in stride. The numerous warnings issued by the FDA over the past two years prompted a drastic slide in sales to the point where most analysts didn't expect Rezulin to be a big seller anymore.
"I don't think the litigation will be as big as you see over diet pills," said Hemant Shah, an analyst who follows the drug industry, referring to the massive litigation against American Home Products Corp., which has agreed to pay $4.8 billion to settle thousands of lawsuits.
In a statement, Warner-Lambert declined to comment on pending litigation, but insisted it had adhered to FDA regulations. "We acknowledge that some patients have experienced adverse events while taking Rezulin. However, the company adequately warned about risks associated with the product, and we intend to vigorously defend any lawsuits."
Warner-Lambert shares were trading at 94, up 3/8, yesterday evening.Copyright 2000 Star-Ledger, provided by Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News.Copyright 2000 Star-Ledger, provided by Knight-Ridder/Tribune Business News.498

Filmmaker discusses cancer caused by recalled drug

Documentary filmmaker Judith Helfand said her mother began taking diethylstilbestrol five weeks into her pregnancy. At the time, many pregnant women took the drug to lower the risk of miscarriage since it was affordable and thought to be safe and effective, she said.
Helfand's mother did not miscarriage, but eight years later, in 1971, she said the FDA banned the drug due to its carcinogenic properties.
An estimated five to 10 million infants were exposed to the drug, which may lead to breast and cervical cancer in girls and testicular abnormalities in the boys, according to the American Cancer Institute's Web site.
"[Millions of] children were affected by this," Helfand said. "This is not a private, familial issue. This disease is both public and political."
Helfand, a documentary filmmaker, presented excerpts from her films Healthy Baby Girl and Blue Vinyl Monday in Trayes Hall of the Douglas Campus Center. The first film recounts her personal struggle with carcinogenic chemicals, which led to cervical cancer.
Helfand said she filmed Healthy Baby Girl over a period of five years, starting in 1990, fully capturing her experience with cancer. She had a radical hysterectomy when she was 25 and was only able to keep were her ovaries.
"I loved the personal perspective she included in the film," said Danielle Winter, a Livingston College sophomore.
Hetfand said soon after completing the first film, her father told her he was going to replace the old red wood outdoor walls of their Merrick, Long Island home with blue vinyl siding.
At first, Helfand said she wanted to get an establishing shot of the red house for Healthy Baby Girl, but then realized a greater problem: the toxicity of vinyl.
She said he new house decor inspired her second film, Blue Vinyl, which led her to locations all over the world, including Lake Charles, La., the biggest producer of polyvinyl chloride plastic.
PVC can be turned into vinyl, she said.
The chemicals from the plants in the area seeped into the groundwater, forcing residents to evacuate their homes at once, Helfand said.
The neighborhoods affected by the chemical were primarily low income, she said.
Helfand spoke along side Rabbi Lawrence Troster of GreenFaith, an interfaith environmental coalition. Justice and equality are central to Judaism and have an obligation to make sure lifestyles do not harm others, he said.
Troster said he worked in the poor Ironbound Section of Newark, known for the large concentrations of Agent Orange still present their today. Ironbound also experienced the largest dioxin spill in history in the local Passaic River, eh said.
"Because the Passaic River is tidal, these chemicals have traveled 15 miles up the Passaic River," he said.
Troster stressed the importance of everyone considering the decisions they make in terms of the environment.
"We have to learn to live as if we are planning to live here, not act as if we are staying in a hotel," Troster said. "When we find a cheap solution [such as vinyl siding], we don't think about the hidden costs."
Helfand said her motto is, "Don't just build a building, build a just building."
Jeffrey Shandler, an associate professor of Jewish Studies, said Helfand made a strong argument both in her presentation and films, making the topic accessible to the audience.
"Film is a very important catalyst in getting a message out, but it's just the beginning," Shandler said. "Rutgers students should be aware of these sort of pressing issues because of their presence in the upcoming presidential election."
Event organizers said Helfand's most recent film, Everything's Cool, a toxic comedy about global warming, will be screening Sunday at 7:30 p.m. in the Graduate Student Lounge of the Rutgers Student Center on the College Avenue campus.

The maker of recalled heart drug Digitek faces at least nine federal lawsuits in New Jersey, including one where a patient died, alleging the drug was dangerous and defective.
The lawsuits were filed in U.S. District Court in Newark in recent months against Actavis Totowa LLL of Morristown, N.J., and its Iceland-based parent, Actavis Group, a generic pharmaceutical company.
Actavis Totowa on April 25 started a nationwide recall of all strengths of the Digitek pills, which are distributed by Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. and UDL Laboratories Inc. Those two companies also are named as defendants, and similar lawsuits have been filed in West Virginia and California.
Actavis said at the time that some tablets may have been double the usual thickness and so would contain twice the active ingredient, digitalis, posing a risk of toxicity with symptoms from nausea and dizziness to low blood pressure and cardiac instability. The company said in a statement that death can result from excessive digitalis intake and that it had received several reports of injuries.
One of the New Jersey lawsuits, filed by the estate of Margaret Lucille Crooker of Kemp, Texas, claimed the drug caused her "serious physical injury, pain and suffering" and she died on March 15.
"Obviously, nobody would have taken it had they been told there is twice as much active ingredient as there is supposed to be," New York attorney Richard Meadow, who represents Crooker's family, told The Record of Bergen County for Friday's editions.
On Friday, Actavis Totowa spokeswoman Hjordis Arnadottir said that "as a rule, we don't comment on any pending lawsuits."
According to the newspaper, one of the lawsuits brought by a Madison, Ind., woman hospitalized from an allegedly toxic overdose of Digitek in June said that a Food and Drug Administration inspection at an Actavis plant had found deviations from good manufacturing practices that led to adulteration of drugs.

Able Laboratories Inc. is recalling all of its manufactured drugs because of serious concerns that the drugs were not produced according to quality assurance standards.
    
Most of the recalled products are generic prescription drugs, including some that contain acetaminophen.
    
The company has ceased all current production until further notice.
    
The Food and Drug Administration is recommending that people who have been taking drugs produced by Able Laboratories speak with their physicians or pharmacists to obtain a replacement drug product.
    
Patients should continue to take the medication until they have spoken with their physicians.
    
"In many cases the risk of suddenly stopping the needed medication before getting replacement drugs may outweigh the risk of continuing to use the recalled products," said Margaret O'K. Glavin, the FDA's associate commissioner for regulatory affairs.

A Rapid City woman has sued the makers of a cholesterol-lowering drug that was recalled four days after her husband died of complications consistent with its use
Pamela Sutterfield's federal court lawsuit seeks unspecified damages against Bayer Corp., GlaxoSmithKline and other parent companies on behalf of her late husband, John Sutterfield.
He died Aug. 4, 2001, from complications from the prescription drug Baycol, according to the lawsuit.
"This was a case where he died of a heart attack and he'd been healthy before that, had recently undergone physical evaluation, and it was shortly after he was started on the Baycol medication that he died unexpectedly," said Mark Connot, Sutterfield's Rapid City lawyer.
Bayer's lawyer did not immediately return a telephone call Friday.
Baycol, a type of drug called a statin, lowers cholesterol levels and reduces the risk of heart disease.
In June 1997, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration let Bayer market Baycol in lower doses. It allowed higher doses in May 1999.
But at least by early 1998, Bayer and GlaxoSmithKline learned that Baycol was linked to a death caused by muscle deterioration. Since then, 52 deaths have been reported that are associated with Baycol. Other patients have suffered muscle damage, the lawsuit states.
Still, Baycol's makers asked the FDA for increased dosages, it states.
They "knew or should have known that Baycol created significant risks of serious injuries or disorders, including damage to kidneys, liver and heart" and did not warn doctors or patients, the lawsuit said.
On Aug. 8, 2001, Bayer announced it was withdrawing Baycol from the market and "finally revealed the dangers associated with Baycol" by sending a letter to doctors, according to the court filing.
For John Sutterfield, it was too late.
He died four days earlier, just a month after starting to use Baycol.
Sutterfield had a physical exam in April 2001. Though it showed his risk of heart problems to be low, he had high cholesterol.
His physician, Dr. David Johnson, prescribed Baycol and also gave Sutterfield some free samples.
Sutterfield started taking Baycol in early July 2001 and immediately developed back and leg muscle pain and cramping, dark-colored urine, fatigue and tiredness - all symptoms of muscle deterioration caused by Baycol, the lawsuit states.
He was found dead in his yard.
"The death was directly related to Baycol," the lawsuit states. It "had an adverse effect upon the liver, kidneys, heart and other organs, contributing to and causing the death of John Howard Sutterfield."
Specifically, the lawsuit says Baycol was defective, more dangerous than other statin drugs, not adequately tested and not accompanied with warnings to doctors or patients about its risk of damage to muscle tissue, kidneys, liver and heart or death.
The lawsuit says Baycol's parent companies knew about the risks but ignored them.
Before it was recalled, Baycol had 5 percent of the market for such drugs and was used by more than 700,000 patients, the lawsuit states.
Bayer and GlaxoSmithKline "falsely and deceptively misrepresented or omitted a number of material facts concerning Baycol, including but not limited to, adverse health effects caused by Baycol," the lawsuit states.

KV Pharmaceutical Co. is recalling dozens of drugs because of potential problems with manufacturing conditions, the company said Monday.
Products named in the recall include generic versions of the antidepressant Toprol XL, hypertension drugs Norvasc and Cardura, a variety of painkillers including OxyContin, and cough and cold treatments. Most of the drugs were made by KV's generic subsidiary, Ethex.
KV said the products were made under conditions that did not comply with standard manufacturing practices.
KV's Ther-Rx division also recalled six production lots of its potassium supplement microK extencaps, and one lot each of its vaginal creams Gynazole and Clindesse.
A full list of the recalled Ethex products can be seen at http://www.ethex.com/news/pressRelease012809.aspx.
Drugs included in the Ther-Rx recall are listed at http://www.ther-rx.com/pressRelease012809.aspx.
The recall was KV's third since November. The company disclosed the recall Monday without naming the products affected. It said it was suspending all manufacturing and shipping of its products.
Most of the drugs were recalled from the wholesale level, but some were recalled from retail pharmacies.
KV shares rose 4 cents, or 8.7 percent, to 50 cents. The stock hit an all-time low of 40 cents earlier in Wednesday's session.

Company Recalls Some Drug-Coated Stents

Boston Scientific Corp. said Friday it is recalling 200 of its recently approved drug-coated coronary stents because of a malfunction that has been blamed for at least one death.
The medical-equipment maker attributed the malfunction to a manufacturing defect that has since been fixed.
A stent is a wire-mesh tube inserted into a heart artery to keep it propped open after the vessel is cleared of a blockage. Some stents are coated with slow-release drugs to prevent scar tissue from creating a new blockage.
A tiny balloon is used to expand the stent inside the artery. But Boston Scientific said a malfunction can prevent the balloon from deflating after it has been used. That can result in death or require bypass surgery.
Boston Scientific reported one death and 16 serious injuries from such a deflation failure to the Food and Drug Administration. But the company said it found the problem in only two recent manufacturing lots of the Taxus Express2 stents.
The recall does not affect patients who have already received a Taxus stent, because the problem turns up only at the time it is implanted. About 445,000 of the stents have been implanted, spokesman Paul Donovan said.
Boston Scientific said it voluntarily recalled the 200 defective stents after detecting the problem through its quality-control process.
The company is notifying the 99 U.S. hospitals and three Canadian hospitals that have received the recalled stents. Company officials said they did not know whether any of the stents had already been implanted.
Boston Scientific received approval from regulators in March to sell the Taxus in the United States. The stent was launched in Europe in 2003.

Health Canada recalls drug to control metal toxicity in dialysis patients

TORONTO _ Health Canada is recalling some lots of a medication used to treat iron and aluminum toxicity in kidney dialysis patients because of the potential for tiny particles to form after the drug is prepared for intravenous administration.
The federal agency is working with manufacturer Hospira Healthcare Corp. to recall certain lots of Desferrioxamine Mesilate for Injection.
The following are being recalled: Lot U072231AA in a 500-milligram format and Lot U102237AA in a two-gram format. The lot number is found on the label of the carton and on the vial.
Hospira Healthcare acquired the product from another company, so the medication will bear the name Mayne Pharma Canada Inc. on the label and carton.
Health Canada said the lots may produce some cloudiness after preparation, the result of small particles that form. These particles may block small blood vessels after injection, so the drug solution should not be used if it becomes cloudy.
Desferrioxamine Mesilate is prescribed for the treatment of acute or chronic iron toxicity and chronic aluminum overload in dialysis patients with end-stage kidney failure.
Patients should not stop using the drug without consulting their health-care practitioner, Health Canada said.
Any affected lot should be returned to the pharmacy for replacement. Patients should check for the DIN and lot number on the product packaging or consult with their pharmacist to determine whether they have product from the affected lots.
Patients should report any adverse reactions to their health-care provider or pharmacist. No adverse reactions have been reported to Health Canada.
For more information, contact Health Canada's public inquiries line at 613-957-2991 or toll-free at 1-866-225-0709.

Highlight: Dr Reddy's Laboratories was ordered to recall the drug Grastim from the Indian market
Body




In an unprecedented move, the Drugs Controller General of India has asked Dr Reddy's Laboratories to withdraw immediately from the market all batches of the company's recently-launched biotechnology cancer drug Grastim (recombinant granulocyte colony stimulating factor filgrastim).
The DGCI's order says the package insert for Grastim "is not in accordance with our approval" given in June this year.
The Economic Times quotes the order as saying that, to be in accordance with the approval granted to the company, it should re-submit the fresh package insert for the approval to the DGCI. "In the meanwhile, withdraw all the batches of the product with the existing package insert," the DGCI order says.
The newspaper, quoting drug industry sources, says the DGCI was unhappy that DRL apparently violated its approval by claiming in the package insert that the drug could be used for severe chronic congenital neutropenia, acute myeloid leukemia, peripheral blood progenitor cell mobilization and allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Sources said the DGCI was not happy that the package insert also failed to caution use of the drug by patients suffering from kidney and liver problems.
In a related development, Nicholas Piramal India has complained to the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission against DRL and saying that the Grastim package insert makes "false and misleading" claims about the efficacy of the drug.Copyright 2001 Marketletter Publications Ltd.Copyright 2001 Marketletter Publications Ltd.218

China's drug regulator ordered a nationwide recall of a hemorrhoid medicine Wednesday because of concerns it may cause liver problems in the latest drug problem to hit the country.
The State Food and Drug Administration said in a statement on its Web site that it had ordered Vital Pharmaceutical Holdings Ltd., based in Sichuan province, to stop producing Zhixue capsules and begin a nationwide recall after 21 people around the country developed liver problems after taking the medicine in recent months.
"An obvious connection can be found between the hemorrhoid medicine and the liver damage after case analysis, but the cause of the adverse reactions remains unknown," the statement said.
China's pharmaceutical industry is highly lucrative but poorly regulated, resulting in some companies using fake or substandard ingredients. In recent years, a string of fatalities blamed on counterfeit or shoddily made medications has been reported.
Several herbal medicines have been recalled in recent months because of suspicions they have caused deaths, according to the official Xinhua News Agency.
The recalls come as China tries to reassure consumers over a scandal involving the spread of the industrial chemical melamine into the food chain, the latest incident to mar its already troubled product safety record.

Three Apotex drugs recalled

The largest Canadian-owned pharmaceutical maker, Apotex Inc., has recalled voluntarily three of its prescription drugs as a "precautionary measure."
The recall follows a recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration import ban on some Apotex products entering the United States, enacted after its officials inspected a manufacturing plant in Etobicoke last year.
The U.S. agency sent a warning in June that said the 2008 inspection found "multiple, serious deficiencies." A Health Canada release Thursday said: "This information comes in light of Health Canada's ongoing inspections of Apotex manufacturing facilities in the Greater Toronto Area."
Yesterday's recall affects apo-meloxicam, used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis in adults; apo-ranitidine, to treat and prevent problems of excess stomach acid; and apo-amilzide, as therapy for patients with liver cirrhosis.
Health Canada noted selected lots of apo-amilzide (5-50mg), apo-meloxicam (7.5 & 15mg) and apo-ranitidine (75 & 150 mg) were recalled.
An Apotex release said the recall was "minor in nature" and "no patient has experienced any problem from taking these medicines."
Elie Betito, an Apotex spokesman, said a majority of the drugs recalled in Canada were produced two years ago and were not the same as those banned by the FDA.
"We are working closely with Health Canada," Betito said. The generic drug maker employs about 5,000 people in Canada.
"Health Canada will continue its inspections of Apotex facilities in Ontario over the coming weeks to verify if other health products are affected and to ensure ... compliance" with good manufacturing practices, it said. "... should Health Canada's inspection reveal a risk to health, immediate and appropriate action will be taken."

Action taken against pharmacy that failed to recall contaminated drugs

The Missouri Board of Pharmacy has won a restraining order against a Kansas City pharmacy that failed to properly recall contaminated drugs.
A Platte County judge issued the restraining order Tuesday against Med 4 Home Pharmacy and said the order would be in effect until March 21.
Med 4 Home Pharmacy failed to properly recall contaminated drugs that the company had compounded, said Kevin Kinkade, the state board's executive director.
The pharmacy company also on March 5 denied a pharmacy board inspector access to its compounding areas, which Kinkade said violated state law.
The restraining order forces the company to stop compounding the drugs.
A spokeswoman for the pharmacy would not comment.
As many as 19,000 patients nationwide might have received the contaminated drug - an Albuterol//Ipratropium inhalant solution to treat chronic lung diseases, such as emphysema and asthma, Kinkade said. Another compounded inhalant, Budesonide, also may have been contaminated.
A routine state inspection revealed a bacteria contaminant - Burkholderia cepacia - in some of the product, Kinkade said.
According to recent research by the Centers for Disease Control, the bacteria is particularly dangerous for patients suffering from cystic fibrosis, in some cases producing a fast-moving, invasive and fatal infection.
Kinkade said the board had not received notice from any patients who became sick because of using the contaminated drugs.
The pharmacy initially recalled only parts of the batches that it thought had been contaminated, instead of the entire product, Kinkade said. He also said the pharmacy had not properly notified patients of the problem.
"This is an issue of public health and safety," Kinkade said. "Certainly a patient on these drugs may already be in a compromised state, and if you introduce an organism into their lungs, it could become pathogenic."
Compounded drugs are not the brand-name prescription drugs that people routinely buy at chain drugstores. Instead, compounded drugs are customized medications, usually mixed in independent pharmacies and without the same safety procedures followed by big drugmakers.
The mail-order pharmacy employs about 250 workers locally.
The state pharmacy board has contacted the FDA. A second court hearing was scheduled for March 21.

FDA Refusal to Recall Risky Drugs A 'Dangerous' Trend, Activists Say

The FDA is failing in its mission of protecting human health by refusing to recall remaining supplies of drugs that have been withdrawn because of health risks, an activist group says.
The agency believes, on the other hand, that its policy is necessary to help patients transition to alternative therapies.
The FDA May 1 rejected Public Citizen's request to recall all remaining supplies of Abbott Laboratories' attention deficit disorder drug Cylert because of several instances of liver failure associated with the product. Abbott voluntarily stopped manufacturing the product in October 2005.
FDA Responds
In the agency response, obtained by WDL, Steven Galson, the director of the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, says that recall is unnecessary because of steps the FDA has already taken to protect public health. Cylert (pemoline) is no longer being marketed and the agency has advised healthcare professionals to transition patients to an alternative therapy, Galson said. "Accordingly, we do not think such a recall is necessary."
But this approach is wrongheaded, placing public health at risk, Sid Wolfe, Public Citizen's Health Research Group director, said.Not recalling the remaining supplies of the drug leaves patients susceptible to the health risks that led the agency to act, Wolfe said. This is a "dangerous kind of choice to make," he added.
The agency took the same approach with two other drugs, Bristol-Myers Squibb's antibiotic Tequin (gatifloxacin) and antidepressant Serzone (nefazodone HCl), Wolfe said. Refusing to recall the remaining supply of a drug deemed too dangerous to stay on the market shows the FDA "is not taking the job of protecting human health very seriously," he added.
While the FDA does not have specific statutory authority to recall drugs, it can use its seizure authority to force a company's hand, Wolfe said.
Companies should voluntarily take these products off the shelves, Wolfe added. Leaving those products could open a company up to product liability suits, he said. Companies that do not recall these drugs are "playing Russian roulette" with future liability.
Recall Unnecessary
However, the agency believes that it is necessary to keep remaining supplies on the shelves, FDA spokeswoman Crystal Rice said. Having Cylert available will help doctors transition their patients to other types of therapy. "FDA attempts to take a broader perspective and be mindful of the needs of all patients rather than focusing narrowly on the risks of a drug." The drug was taken from the market mostly on the increasing availability of alternative treatments, rather than new risk data, she added.
Product recalls are not a major issue for the drug industry, according to PhRMA. "To put the whole situation into perspective, it should be reassuring that over the last 30 years fewer than 3 percent of medicineshave been withdrawn from the market for safety reasons," PhRMA spokesman Jeff Trewhitt said.
But the group believes that companies must be aggressive in recalling harmful products. "Companies that don't move quickly enough in product recall situations riskreceiving expensive product liability lawsuits," Trewhitt added.
Abbott did not respond to a request for comment. -- Stephen Langel

The government ordered a nationwide recall of a horse drug sold over the Internet - Miracle Leg Paint - because it contains mercury that is poisonous to horses and people.
The FDA said owners who purchased the product should contact local waste-management authorities to determine how to destroy it without endangering animals, people or waterways.
Miracle Leg Paint, marketed by Equine Miracle Corp. of Grapeland, Texas, contains a mercuric chloride blistering agent.
Compiled from Wire Reports
An old folk remedy for lameness and other leg ailments was to irritate the horse's skin with that or similar chemicals, thinking the blister would cause disease-fighting blood cells to descend on the area and help the original ailment, said Dr. Stephen Sundlof, FDA's veterinary medicine chief.
MORE HORSES: Palimony lawyer Marvin Mitchelson said he will try to collect part of the winnings earned by Triple Crown threat War Emblem to satisfy a $216-million judgment against a Saudi Arabian sheik. Sheika Dena Al Fassi said estranged husband Sheik Mohammed Al Fassi claimed members of the Saudi royal family, including War Emblem owner Prince Ahmed bin Salman, control his money and assets. War Emblem, winner of the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes, could net a $5-million bonus to his owners with a Belmont win June 8. Jockey Joe Bravo will be sidelined three months after breaking his left wrist in a fall during a race Thursday at Monmouth Park in New Jersey.
BOXING: Former middleweight champion James Toney (66-4-1) stopped Tampa's Michael Rush (23-6-1) in the 10th round of their cruiserweight bout at Chinook Winds Casino in Lincoln City, Ore. Evander Holyfield (37-5-2) faces Hasim Rahman (35-3) tonight at Atlanta City in a 12-round, nontitle bout. The winner becomes the WBC's No. 1 contender and faces the Lennox Lewis-Mike Tyson winner. Holyfield, 39, hopes to regain his title and retire as undisputed world heavyweight champion. Lewis got a champion's welcome in Memphis and Tyson slipped into town with little notice, arriving by private jet. After a parade through the city's Beale Street entertainment district, Lewis predicted he will retain his heavyweight title with a knockout. He meets Tyson at the Memphis Pyramid on June 8. Romania's Leonard Dorin (21-0) defended his WBA lightweight title in Bucharest, outpointing Argentina's Raul Balbi.
CYCLING: Mario Cipollini (4 hours, 12 minutes, 44 seconds) won the 18th stage at Brescia in the Giro d'Italia, and Paolo Savoldelli retained the overall lead. Defending champion Gilberto Simoni tested positive for cocaine in a second doping test conducted before he withdrew May 24. Stefan Ruetimann tested positive for the anabolic steroid testosterone in the final stage of the Tour de Romandie on May 5 at Bern, Switzerland. Ruetimann, who finished a six-month doping ban in March, could be banned up to four years.
HOCKEY: A teenager who shot a puck at his opponents' bench May 14 in Chicago received a six-month suspension by Illinois' AHA. The review committee recommended the coaches of the Rolling Meadows Chargers and Buffalo Grove Sharks be investigated by the rules and ethics committee over an alleged exchange of threats and obscenities.
RHYTHMIC GYMNASTICS: Russians Alina Kabaeva and Irina Tchachina, who received one-year bans for doping May 8, will appeal. They tested positive at the August Goodwill Games in Sydney for furosemide, a diuretic sometimes used to lose weight quickly or to mask other products.

Health Canada is warning people not to use Libidus, an unauthorized product promoted for treating erectile dysfunction, as it may pose serious health risks.
Libidus has been found to contain the undeclared prescription drug sildenafil, which should be used only under supervision by a health professional.
Use of sildenafil by people with heart disease can result in sudden cardiac death, heart attack, stroke, low blood pressure, chest pain and abnormal heartbeat. As well, the drug may cause such side-effects as vision loss, seizure, sudden decrease or loss of hearing, dizziness, prolonged erection, headache, flushing, nasal congestion, indigestion and abdominal pain.
Libidus is labelled as manufactured by Yurtland Natural Health and is distributed by NorthRegentRX of Winnipeg, which has been ordered to recall the product. Libidus may be available at retail outlets across Canada and over the Internet.
Retailers should remove Libidus from their shelves and consumers should return the product to place of purchase, said Health Canada, which is taking steps to confirm that the product has been removed from the Canadian market.
Consumers who have used Libidus and are concerned about their health should consult their health-care professional.
Canadians concerned about erectile dysfunction should consult with their health provider to discuss appropriate and authorized treatments.

Chinese authorities ordered the recall of tainted leukemia drugs blamed for leg pains and other problems, state media reported Sunday, the latest crisis to strike the country's embattled food and drug industries.
Most of the drugs involved methotrexate and cytarabin hydrochloride have been recovered and authorities have traced the remainder, the Xinhua News Agency said. The report did not say if any of the drugs had been exported.
Authorities have banned the sale and distribution of the drugs, produced by the Shanghai Hualian Pharmaceutical Co., it said.
China, a major global supplier, has been facing growing international pressure to improve the quality of its exports after dangerous toxins from lead to an antifreeze ingredient were found in goods including toys and toothpaste.
China has been eager to cast itself as a victim, too, of unsafe imports. Xinhua on Saturday announced that inspectors recently found residue of the banned stimulant ractopamine in frozen pig kidneys imported from the United States and frozen pork spareribs from Canada. The names of the exporting companies were not identified. Ractopamine is forbidden for use as veterinary medicine in China.
Xinhua said the 18.37 tons of frozen pork kidneys and 24 tons of frozen pork had been returned to importers exporters, said the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ).
Ractopamine, a hormone that promotes the growth of lean meat in pigs and cattle, is banned by China and most other countries as a health hazard, although its use in stock animals is permitted in the U.S. and Canada. China has also recently banned imports of U.S. meat contaminated with salmonella, additives, and veterinary drugs.
Xinhua said the State Food and Drug Administration and Health Ministry banned the two leukemia drugs after several child leukemia patients who were taking them complained of leg pains and difficulty walking. Xinhua said some patients also complained of urine retention.
It said the Health Ministry and drug administration had traced the problems with the drugs to their being tainted with vincristine sulfate, an anticancer drug. Xinhua said factories manufacturing the drugs had been closed.
China has taken a series of steps to crackdown on tainted drugs and other unsafe products, in part due to concern over the reputation of its exports.
In the harshest action so far, the country's former top drug regulator was executed in July for taking millions of dollars in bribes to approve substandard medicines, including an antibiotic that killed at least 10 people.

Miracle Leg Paint, marketed by Equine Miracle Corp. of Grapeland, Texas, contains a mercuric chloride blistering agent.
An old folk remedy for lameness and other horse leg ailments was to irritate the horse's skin with that or similar chemicals, on the theory that the blister would cause disease-fighting blood cells to descend on the area and help the original leg ailment, said Dr. Stephen Sundlof, FDA's veterinary medicine chief.
Only later did scientists discover mercury is toxic, and people who get mercury-containing agents over much of their skin can become seriously ill, even die, he added.
An Alabama veterinarian called the FDA on April 30 to say he had just autopsied a horse whose owner had applied Miracle Leg Paint. While there is no evidence the product played a role in the horse's death, Sundlof said, it did spark an FDA investigation.
Equine Miracle Corp. was selling an unapproved drug, Sundlof said. The company agreed to recall it Thursday.
Georgia Brown, who with her husband owns Equine Miracle, angrily asked why the FDA didn't shut her down in 1999, when she first faxed the agency the ingredient label of the then-new product and before the couple invested their life savings in it. She said veterinarians are among her customers but had never voiced safety concerns.
But the FDA said it wasn't aware Brown sold the product in 1999 - officials thought she was asking permission to sell. In February 2001, the FDA wrote Brown to say she hadn't provided enough evidence to win such approval.

CDER performed 45 Class I recalls of human drugs deemed to have "very serious potential to cause harm, injury or death" in the last fiscal year, according to Joe Famulare, acting deputy director of CDER's Office of Compliance.
That number is "very significant," since many years there are only one or two such recalls, Famulare told attendees at the 2006 Generic Pharmaceutical Association Fall Technical Conference Oct. 19.
The period from Oct. 1, 2005, to Sept. 30, 2006, also saw 193 Class II recalls of drugs deemed "to have the potential to cause harm," but where the damage is reversible, and 128 Class III recalls, which are generally for labeling violations and do not pose a direct health hazard, Famulare said.
These recall numbers include drugs that have not yet received full approval but for which new drug applications or abbreviated new drug applications have been submitted, and certain biologics that CDER also regulates, Famulare said.
Some of the top reasons for recalls in fiscal 2006 were:
Subpotency in single-ingredient drugs;
Impurity;
Defective containers;
Nonsterile products, which are a particular problem for goods "manufactured in nontraditional settings;" and
Superpotency.
CDER officials are finding that certain companies have major problems with current good manufacturing practices, which "results in our having to remove whole classes of products," Famulare said.

Painkiller recall affects Utah drug stores

Employees at dozens of Albertsons and Smith's Food and Drug stores in Utah pulled private label painkillers with acetaminophen from shelves Thursday after a major manufacturer of the drug recalled 11 million bottles that may be contaminated with metal fragments.
Nationally, there were no immediate reports of injuries or illness from the pills, which included fragments ranging in size from ''microdots'' to portions of wire one-third of an inch long, the Food and Drug Administration said.
The recall affects bottles containing various amounts of 500-milligram caplets made by the Perrigo Co. The recall does not affect the Tylenol brand.
Smith's and Albertsons are among 129 retailers that typically sell Perrigo-made pills under private labels and could potentially be affected by the recall. Others include Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Safeway Stores.
Smith's sells the Perrigo-made painkillers under its Kroger label at 47 Utah stores.
"We were able to identify the products we were carrying that were recalled," said Marsha Gilford, a spokeswoman for Smith's. "Our customers should throw away the products or bring them back for a refund."
Staff at 46 Albertsons stores in Utah also removed the products, sold as Equaline, from their shelves.
"The health and safety of our customers is our number one concern," said spokeswoman Donna Eggers. "Customers can return affected product to SUPERVALU/Albertsons for a full refund."
The Food and Drug Administration has posted on its Web site the recalled batch numbers for customers to compare with any bottles they have purchased. The site also has the names of the dozens of chains supplied by Perrigo, which bills itself as the world's largest manufacturer of store-brand nonprescription drugs.
Associated Foods, which includes the Harmon's, Dan's and Macey's stores in Utah, was not affected by the recall. The company gets its private-label acetaminophen, under the name Western Family aspirin-free pain relief, from LNK, based out of Hauppauge, N.Y.
Perrigo discovered the metal bits in its pills during quality-control checks after realizing the equipment it uses to make the pills was wearing down prematurely, the FDA said.
A company investigation turned up metal in roughly 200 pills, after passing 70 million of the caplets through a metal detector, according to the FDA.
Consumers who swallow any of the contaminated pills could suffer minor stomach discomfort or possible cuts to the mouth and throat, the FDA said, adding that the risk of serious injury was remote. Anyone who suspects they have been injured should contact a doctor, the agency said.
Perrigo, based in Allegan, Mich., said the pills contained raw material purchased from a third-party supplier and affected 383 batches. A company spokesman did not immediately return a call seeking comment.
Acetaminophen is best known as the drug in products sold under the Tylenol brand, but is widely available in generic versions. The drug, along with aspirin and ibuprofen, is one of the most widely used pain relievers available without a doctor's note. The retail market for the pain relievers is worth more than $2 billion a year, according to Perrigo.
The recall should not cause a shortage of acetaminophen, the FDA said.
The voluntary recall is considered a Class II recall since it covers products that might cause a temporary health problem or pose only a slight threat of a serious nature, according to the FDA.
Consumers with questions can call Perrigo toll free at 877-546-0454.On the Web
Customers can check online whether products they bought are being recalled.

Recall Expanded for Cholesterol Drug

Length: 305 words

Two pharmaceutical distributors have expanded the recall of the cholesterol drug Lipitor to include Lipitor products repackaged by a Nebraska company, pending a Food and Drug Administration probe tracking thousands of bottles of counterfeit pills.
Albers Medical Distributors Inc. of Kansas City, Mo., and H.D. Smith Wholesale Drug Co. of Springfield, Ill., are recalling all Lipitor products repacked by MED-PRO Inc. of Lexington, Neb., the FDA announced Tuesday.
Fake Lipitor could have harmful effects if taken in place of the real drug because it has not been proven effective at lowering cholesterol, although it contains the same active ingredient, atorvastatin. The FDA has not identified any harmful substances in the fake tablets, but testing continues.
The recalled bottles are marked "Repackaged by: MED-PRO Inc., Lexington, NE 68850. If consumers discover bottles with that stamp, they should not take the pills but return the product to their pharmacy, the FDA said. Patients who are unsure whether the pills they have are authentic should consult their pharmacist. Consumers can also contact the FDA at 1-888-INFO-FDA.
"Individual tablets of this counterfeit medicine may vary significantly, even within individual lots, because the source of the atorvastatin is unknown and because there is no evidence that the tablets have been produced according to good manufacturing practices," the FDA said.
Earlier this month, the maker of the authentic Lipitor, Pfizer Inc., filed suit against Albers Medical Distributors and MED-PRO Inc. to stop the companies from selling any more fake versions of the drug. The FDA ordered Albers Medical Distributors to recall 100,000 bottles marked as Lipitor on May 23 after the fake drug was discovered on the market.

Boston Scientific Corp. said Friday it was voluntarily recalling 200 units of its recently approved drug-coated coronary stent because of a problem with a tiny balloon placed inside arteries to inflate the stent once it has been surgically moved into place. Its shares slipped in midday trading.
The problem, which can prevent the balloon from deflating during angioplasty, turned up in two manufacturing lots of the Taxus Express2 stent and was detected through the company's quality-control process, Boston Scientific said in a news release.
The problem has been the subject of 30 complaints from doctors, company spokesman Paul Donovan said. He said that 445,000 stents have already been implanted.
Balloons that fail to deflate after artery-clearing surgery can result in complications including coronary artery bypass surgery and death, Boston Scientific said.
The Natick-based company said it has notified the U.S. Food and Drug Administration of one death and 16 serious injuries associated with the problem. Boston Scientific said it had received eight reports of balloon malfunctions that did not lead to injury.
Boston Scientific was sending notification about the recall to the 99 U.S. hospitals and three Canadian hospitals that have received shipments of the stent.
Boston Scientific received approval from regulators on March 4 to sell its Taxus system in the United States. The stent was launched in Europe in 2003.
The company said the recall does not effect patients who have already received a Taxus stent because the problem turns up at the time the stent is implanted rather than afterward.
In late trading, Boston Scientific shares were down 44 cents, or about 1 percent, at $42.26 on the New York Stock Exchange.

The FDA announced a crackdown on two companies' marketing of unapproved drugs, including a consent decree prohibiting them from continuing the practice and a request by the agency to recall all they have already sold.
In addition to the action against Syntho Pharmaceuticals and Intermax Pharmaceuticals, the agency said Oct. 5 it sent warning letters to four other firms as part of its ongoing effort against marketed unapproved drugs.
Syntho and Intermax manufactured and distributed drugs without the required FDA approval, the agency said, adding that the products also did not meet current good manufacturing practices (cGMP).
The agency's agreement with the companies is a permanent injunction preventing Syntho and Intermax from manufacturing, processing, packing, labeling and distributing several cough-cold medications and an antiseptic for urinary tract infections. Syntho and Intermax must also stop manufacturing and distributing drugs until the FDA determines they comply with cGMP requirements.
A guidance document issued by the FDA in June 2006, "Marketed Unapproved Drugs -- Compliance Policy Guide," says firms whose drugs require FDA approval must submit applications showing their products are safe and effective before marketing those products.
The new warning letters were issued to Neil Laboratories, Concord Laboratories, Scientific Laboratories and Sheffield Laboratories. Neil would not comment on the warning letter, Concord and Sheffield could not be reached for comment by press time and no number was listed for Scientific Laboratories.

A pharmaceutical company is expanding a nationwide recall from last month to cover all lots of a drug used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and narcolepsy.
The Methylin Chewable Tablets may contain wrong amounts of its active ingredient, which could pose health risks to some patients, Alliant Pharmaceuticals Inc. said Wednesday.
The Alpharetta, Ga.-based company voluntarily recalled a single lot of its 5-milligram strength tablets on Jan. 14, saying they may contain as much as three times the active ingredient.
Further investigation by the manufacturer, Mallinckrodt Inc. of St. Louis, found that tablets of all dosage strengths may have too much or too little methylphenidate.
The drug's maker blamed the potential problem on a "mixing issue" but said nothing is wrong with the active ingredient.
Alliant chief executive Mark Pugh said no other problems have been discovered beyond the initially recalled 5-milligram lot, but that the company decided to expand the recall as a precaution. No one has reported adverse effects from taking the drug, he said.
The recalled medication came in 100-tablet bottles of the following lot numbers:
-2.5-milligram dosage: AMT20401A, AMT20402A, AMT20403A, AMT20404A.
-5-milligram dosage: AMT50401A, AMT50402A (previously recalled), AMT50403A, AMT50404A.
-10-milligram dosage: AMT100401A, AMT100402A, AMT100403A, AMT100404A.
Pugh said fewer than 5,000 bottles of approximately 10,000 manufactured have been distributed.
Alliant Pharmaceuticals, which is cooperating with the Food and Drug Administration on the recall, said it is sending letters to wholesalers and pharmacists. The company is urging distributors and pharmacies to quarantine any medicine that matches the lot numbers, and is asking pharmacists to notify patients who received the prescriptions.
More information is available to patients and health care providers by calling the company at 770-817-4500, weekdays 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST.

Family files $25 million lawsuit against maker of recalled drug patch

The family of a woman who drowned in her bathtub after using a pain medication patch has filed a $25 million lawsuit against the maker, Johnson & Johnson.
The suit alleges Patricia C. Wroten died on Feb. 6 as a result of a faulty Duragesic patch that leaked dangerous levels of opiates into her body.
Co-defendant Janssen Pharmaceutica Products LP, the Titusville, N.J.-based subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson that produces Duragesic, recalled a batch of the patches in February after determining that some leaked medication along one edge. The plaintiffs claim the patch worn by Wroten, 51, when she died was from the recalled lot, but that a warning of the problem arrived after Wroten died.
Duragesic is a prescription-only medication for "moderate to severe chronic pain," according to a Web site posted by its manufacturer. The patch contains fentanyl, "an opioid pain medication" and can function for up to three days.
Wroten was washing her hair in the bathtub when the harmful effects of the drug hit her, rendered her unconscious and led to her drowning, the suit alleges.
"It was not a heart attack and it was not high blood pressure," said the family's lawyer, Marvin Ellin. A copy of the state medical examiner's report attached to the lawsuit gives the cause of death as drowning.
Ellin said he believed that while some patients have suffered injuries as a result of the faulty patches, Wroten is the only one he knows of who died.
Alza Corp., the California-based company that manufactures the patches, also was named as a defendant in the suit. It became a wholly owned subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson in 2001.

INDUSTRY GRAPPLES WITH DRUG RECALL CHALLENGES
The Food & Drug Letter
July 18, 2003

 Copyright 2003 Washington Business Information, Inc., All Rights Reserved
Section: No. 679
Length: 1348 words
Body




The nation's prescription drug recall system remains hamstrung by inconsistent enforcement and reporting processes, and the FDA not having enough authority -- particularly in the growing problem of counterfeit drugs.
"There are no real systems in place to effectively monitor" counterfeit drug reports, said FDA consultant and pharmacist Sarah Sellers, citing the influx of imported drugs and the proliferation of drugs now available over the internet (see related story, Page 8).
FDA Associate Commissioner for Regulatory Affairs Dennis Baker told the House Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations June 8 that the FDA has "little or no control" over the import of overseas counterfeit drugs.
Similarly, the FDA does not have direct authority to order a company to perform a recall under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), and largely must rely on industry to police itself. Most recalls are prompted by adverse event reports collected by drug companies through a system the FDA currently is attempting to streamline to make more effective.
The agency has issued a proposed rule to improve adverse-event reporting procedures that industry presently is reviewing. The comment period recently was extended to Oct. 14 (see related story, Page 6).
The Recall Process
At present, a product recall is a voluntary process initiated by the company and monitored by the FDA, in most cases. If a firm refuses to recall a product the FDA has determined to be a hazard to the public health, the FDA can seek legal action under the FDCA. This action can include seizure of inventories, an injunction of the firm if the agency sees a pattern of violations with a recognizable danger of reoccurrence or a court request for a recall.
The agency provides industry with guidance on how to conduct a recall in 21 CFR Part 7, Subpart C. The regulations cover the agency's policy on recalls, evaluation and classification of recalls, recall strategy, expected communications, public notification, status reports and conditions whereby a recall may be terminated (see sidebar, Page 4).
There were 354 prescription drug recalls in fiscal 2002, according to the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research's (CDER's) "Report To The Nation 2002." That was up from 248 in 2001. The FDA describes drug recalls and "field corrections" as actions taken to either remove a product from the market or conduct a correction.
According to the "Report To The Nation 2002," CDER's top reasons for drug recalls in fiscal 2002 were:
*
Penicillin cross contamination;
* Lack of assurance of sterility;
* Labeling: wrong or incorrect expiration date;
* Subpotency;
* Labeling: incorrect product or mispacking/miscarton;
* Particulate matter;
* Good manufacturing practices (GMPs) deviations; and
* Foreign substance.
Lotronex Case Points to Flaws
High-profile recalls can highlight flaws in the system, experts said, especially with regard to market pressure and the FDA's secondary role to industry in the process.
Immediately after the announcement of the safety-related withdrawal of Lotronex in 2000, distraught patients began contacting the FDA "demanding access to a drug they characterized as 'giving them their lives back,'" CDER said in the "Report To The Nation 2002."
Lotronex (alosetron), a treatment for irritable bowel syndrome in women, was withdrawn because a known side effect, ischemic colitis, was more serious than predicted during clinical trials, and serious complications, including constipation and even death, arose.
CDER worked with the manufacturer, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK), to compile a formal risk management program for alosetron, which was approved last year.
GSK narrowed the indicated patient population and specified a lower starting dose on the label.
But last September, a consultant hired by the FDA to help review Lotronex claimed that pressure from the drug's sponsor prompted the agency to allow it back onto the market, despite the safety concerns.
In an article published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), Paul Stolley, a retired University of Maryland professor, also said his critical assessments of the drug were not taken seriously enough. Stolley left the FDA in June 2001, about a year before the agency allowed the drug back onto the market, with restrictions.
In allowing Lotronex back on the market, the FDA has failed to protect the public health by ensuring that drugs are safe, according to an accompanying BMJ editorial by Michel Lievre, an associate professor in the Clinical Pharmacology Unit, Faculte de Medecine Laennec in Lyons, France.
Lievre asserted that the FDA transferred responsibility to patients by "asking them to attest that they belong to the target population and can manage the risks."
Under a new marketing program, patients are asked to read and sign an agreement stating that they understand the risks of the treatment before receiving their initial prescription for Lotronex.
Signs of Improvement
The system is showing signs of improvement. Industry experts cited the agency's revamping of its GMPs as an important first step in improving the safety of the nation's prescription drugs.
The FDA unveiled its first major overhaul in 25 years of its enforcement of GMPs in August 2002, and has been phasing in the program in several waves that emphasize a risk-based approach to enforcement (FDL, April 25, Page 1).
"The theory with the risk-based GMPs is that it will ultimately result in fewer mistakes" in the drug manufacturing process, said William Vodra, former associate chief counsel for the FDA. That could translate into fewer drug recalls, said Vodra, now the head of the food, drug and medical devices group at the Washington, D.C., law firm Arnold and Porter.
"The FDA has placed more emphasis on the distribution process" in its new GMP approach, added Ronald Riggin, chief technology officer at MARC Global. This is accomplished through surveillance and sampling of domestic and foreign finished dosage forms and bulk shipments of active ingredients.
The pace of recalls thus far in 2003 seems to have slowed, experts noted, although exact figures are not yet available from CDER.
"The FDA has been less active [on recalls] over the last six to twelve months," said attorney Joseph Hetrick, a partner with Dechert in Philadelphia. "But I'm not sure whether that is because the FDA is keeping its hands off, or things are just quiet."
Vodra noted that more firms seem to be taking the voluntary enforcement path following the $500 million Schering-Plough consent decree in May 2002 and the FDA's "ratcheted up" enforcement.
The actions seem to have sent the message that if firms do not police themselves, the agency would come down hard if prompted to take GMP-related action (see related story, Page 6).
CDER Sets Recall Categories
The Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CDER) classifies recall actions in accordance with the level of risk and participates in determining recall strategies based on the health hazard posed by the product and other factors, including the extent of distribution of the product. Recalls fall under the following categories.
Class I
A Class I recall is the most serious and is ordered when there is a reasonable probability that the use of, or exposure to, a product will cause serious adverse health consequences or death. There were no Class I safety recalls in the U.S. last year, CDER said.
Class II
A Class II recall involves a situation in which use of, or exposure to, a product may cause temporary or medically reversible adverse health consequences where "the probability of serious adverse health consequences is remote."
Class III
A Class III recall is a situation in which use of or exposure to a product is not likely to cause adverse health consequences.
During any recall, CDER coordinates recall information, assists manufacturers or distributors in developing recall plans and prepares health hazard evaluations to determine the risk posed to the public by products being recalled. The center also determines the need for public warnings and assists firms with public notification about the recall.

A maker of the potent anesthetic propofol found in Michael Jackson's home has been contacted by federal officials investigating the pop star's death and has recalled tens of thousands of vials of the drug after two tainted lots sickened dozens of patients.
There is no apparent connection between the bacterial contamination that prompted the recall and Jackson's death on June 25, Teva Pharmaceuticals spokeswoman Denise Bradley told The Associated Press on Tuesday. The tracking number on the tainted lots was different from the number on a vial that Drug Enforcement Administration investigators told the company was found at Jackson's home, she said.
Propofol usually is administered intravenously in hospitals to patients who need to be unconscious for surgery or other procedures. A central question in the Jackson investigation is who provided that drug and other prescription medications found at his rented Beverly Hills mansion. Investigators are talking to doctors who treated Jackson.
On Tuesday, Los Angeles assistant chief corner Ed Winter went to the offices of Dr. Arnold Klein, Jackson's dermatologist, seeking subpoenaed medical records. Klein's attorney, Richard Charnley, said in a statement that the doctor will provide the documents Wednesday.
Klein has said he sometimes sedated the pop star for medical procedures but never prescribed propofol.
Meanwhile, a nurse who provided nutritional therapy for Michael Jackson said Tuesday that she was interviewed by Los Angeles homicide detectives who told her needle marks were found on the pop singer the day he died. Cherilyn Lee said she told the detectives that she didn't see any so-called "track marks" on Jackson's arms when she visited his home to provide vitamins and other supplements earlier this year.
The detectives replied that "the day the paramedics came (to Jackson's house), he had a lot of track marks," Lee said.
Lee also was asked in the 20-minute interview at her office last Friday if she saw bruising on Jackson. Lee said she didn't but told police Jackson's veins were small, which made placing an IV needle difficult and could result in bruising.
Lee has said Jackson asked her for Diprivan, the brand-name version of propofol, to alleviate his insomnia. She said she refused to help him get access to the drug.
Lee, a registered nurse, said Jackson had complained of sleeplessness and told her he knew that Diprivan could provide immediate relief. She cautioned him the drug was to be administered in a hospital under careful supervision and had potentially dangerous side effects.
Jackson replied that he would be "fine as long as I'm monitored. ... He knew that somebody should monitor him with equipment," Lee said, which she took as an indication that he had used Diprivan before.
Lee was asked if there was an IV pole at Jackson's house, and told detectives that the only one she saw was the one she brought to administer a vitamin-mineral supplement, known as a "Myers' cocktail," through a needle placed in the back of Jackson's hand. While administering the vitamin IV on several occasions, Lee said, she needed to move Jackson's sleeves up his arms and saw no evidence of needle marks. She treated the singer from January to April.
Jackson investigators are seeking to trace how propofol ended up in his home. Teva can provide information on which distributor bought specific vials. From there, distributors typically sell directly to hospitals or doctors.
Bradley said she didn't know which distributor handled the drug found at Jackson's home. DEA spokesman Rusty Payne declined to comment.
Teva announced it was recalling two lots of propofol 57,620 vials in all after concluding bacterial contamination caused up to 40 patients in Florida, Arizona and Missouri to develop fevers and chills since May. Investigators believe vials were distributed nationally and are urging doctors not to use any propofol from the two lots.
Most of the affected patients were undergoing an endoscopy, an examination in which a tube-like instrument, usually with a camera attached, is passed into an area of the body such as the colon or esophagus. One patient was hospitalized and all recovered, said Dr. Arjun Srinivasan, lead investigator for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Karen Riley, spokeswoman for the Food and Drug Administration that oversees drug recalls, said the contamination was found in a single outpatient facility in each of the three states. She did not identify the sites.
FDA investigators arrived Monday at the Teva plant in Irvine, Calif., where the suspect lots were made and were looking for any irregularities in the manufacturing process, Riley said.
Investigators believe that bacteria in vials of the anesthetic released toxins into the drug which caused the fever, Srinivasan said.

Generics maker recalls all its drugs

Generic drug maker Able Laboratories Inc. suspended manufacturing operations Monday and recalled all of its products after an internal investigation turned up problems with testing procedures for some of its drugs.
The decision came days after Able, which has been examining its practices since recalling several batches of drugs earlier this year, chose to halt all product shipments and warned that more recalls could be on the way.
On Thursday, shortly after Able released findings from its review and withdrew previous financial guidance, Chairman and Chief Executive Dhananjay G. Wadekar resigned. Able's stock lost about three quarters of its value that day.
In trading Monday, shares of Able fell $2.14, or nearly 30 percent, to close at $5.05.
Able said Monday that halting product manufacturing and distribution was an additional precaution while it completes the investigation and ensures that its operations are on par with regulatory guidelines.
The company also pulled seven new-drug applications to the Food and Drug Administration, citing commercial reasons and the identification of data that can no longer be relied upon. It will continue reviewing its portfolio of drug candidates and withdraw more pending applications if it finds invalid data, Able said.
"This disruption in business is expected to have a material adverse effect on the company's business and results of operations," Able said, adding that it does not know what other actions it may take or whether the FDA or a government office will add further sanctions.
Able, which makes generic versions of attention-deficit disorder drug Ritalin and the painkiller Vicodin, earlier this month said its profit nearly doubled during the three months ended March 31, with sales surging 43 percent to $30.7 million.

Apotex recalls lots of three drugs in Canada*

More signs of manufacturing trouble at Apotex. The generics maker is recalling lots of three drugs in Canada: Apo-Amilzide, liver cirrhosis treatment; Apo-Meloxicam, an arthritis remedy and generic version of Abbott Labs' Mobic; and Apo-Ranitidine, a stomach-acid drug and generic form of GlaxoSmithKline's Zantac. The move comes as Health Canada, like the FDA, is scrutinizing Apotex's manufacturing facilities.
The agency said that other products may join the recall queue if problems are revealed during its ongoing inspections at Apotex's plants. An agency spokeswoman told Reuters that there are no safety or efficacy problems with the three recalled products. A review of operating procedures raised questions about whether certain manufacturing processes were properly followed.
Apotex has been wrangling with the FDA over manufacturing breaches inspectors found at company facilities in the Toronto area. Three weeks ago, the FDA imposed an "import alert," banning export of pills made in those facilities to the U.S. The agency said Apotex didn't investigate some batch failures thoroughly and that it had produced an abnormally high number of failed batches. If the company doesn't fix the manufacturing problems, it could see its approval applications at FDA frozen until it does.

Bayer recalls cholesterol drug: Lowers profit forecast

LEVERKUSEN, Germany - Bayer AG pulled Baycol, its third-best selling medicine, after the cholesterol-lowering drug was linked to 31 deaths in the United States. The company also reduced profit forecasts for the second time in six weeks, sending its shares down 18%, the biggest drop in at least a decade.
Germany's largest drugmaker withdrew Baycol, also known as Lipobay, from most markets after patients suffered severe muscle weakness that can lead to organ failure.
Bayer said 2001 operating profit will fall more than a 10% decline predicted in June, amid slowing chemical sales and production delays for the hemophilia medicine Kogenate, its fifth-best seller. Baycol, the fastest-growing of Bayer's top drugs, had revenue potential of US$1-billion or more, analysts said.
'It's disastrous,' said Leen den Hollander at Kempen & Co. 'One of their main profit makers is falling away.' He doesn't own Bayer shares.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which reported the U.S. deaths yesterday, said patients were also taking a medication known as gemfibrozil in 12 of the 31 cases. Bayer had previously warned against combining the drugs and said it plans to keep selling Baycol in Japan, where gemfibrozil is not available.
The company told investors on June 27 that 2001 operating profit before interest and tax would fall to about three billion euros. 'This goal is unattainable,' Werner Wenning , chief financial officer, said yesterday.
Manfred Schneider, chief executive, who has eight months left on the job, has to steer Bayer through slow chemical demand and lost income in health care, which last year made up 45% of earnings. Bayer also dropped its goal of increasing health-care operating profit to 20% of sales by the end of 2002.

Advertising Recall for Prescription Drugs Rises

   A growing number of consumers recall seeing ads for prescription drugs. But the percentage of consumers that take action has leveled off, according to Ipsos PharmTrends, a syndicated tracking study of consumer behavior by Ipsos, the global marketing research firm.
    Sixty percent of consumers said they had seen advertising for prescription drugs in the 12 months before February 2003, up significantly from 47% during the same period last year. The rising consumer recall figure is consistent with increasing ad expenditures by drug manufacturers, the study noted.
Nearly one out of four consumers (20%) said that direct-to-consumer advertising prompted them to call or visit their doctor to discuss the prescription drug they saw advertised. This meter for measuring call to action for this product category has remained the same over the past three survey periods.
DTC advertising can also help remind patients to refill their prescriptions. In the February 2003 survey, 15% of the consumers interviewed said that prescription drug ads reminded them to refill a prescription for the drug they saw advertised. This is up from 12% a year ago.
Sufferers of chronic conditions reported a disproportionately higher level of response to DTC as a refill reminder. Categories where consumer response was significantly greater than the total response average of 15% include Anxiety/Social Anxiety Disorder 25%; Depression 22%; Insomnia 22%; Hormone Replacement Therapy 20%; Migraine Headaches 20%; Incontinence 19%.

Monitoring group: ephedra danger hasn't yet ended: Recalled drug still sold

VANCOUVER (CP) -- The federal government is failing to protect consumers by approving potentially dangerous drugs such as ephedra and then leaving it to the provinces to determine what dosages are safe, says a spokesman for the Canadian Health Coalition.
"They're allowing on to the market drugs that are clearly high-risk and dangerous," Mike McBane said of the drug that has been linked to 80 deaths in the United States since 1994 and one in Canada late last year.
CP
Small amounts of ephedra, or its chemical derivative ephedrine, are permitted in products such as nasal decongestants, cough medicine and cough syrup, for limited use.
In January, Health Canada recalled ephedra products that make claims about weight loss or increased energy.
But two American-made drugs, Stacker 2 and Xenadrine, continue to be sold in some health-food stores in Canada as nasal decongestants that are also promoted as fat burners and energy boosters.
Ottawa approves drugs for safety and efficacy and allows them to be sold either with a prescription or without.
It's up to provincial pharmacists' colleges to decide what is a safe dose for an over-the-counter drug or whether the product should be sold in a pharmacy with a doctor's prescription.
But McBane said provinces don't have the resources to monitor drugs being sold in health-food stores or fitness clubs.
"They're (the federal Health Department) experts at passing the buck and diverting the attention from the real issue, which is the federal government drug approval system is not doing its job," he said.

Organ Transplant Drug Recalled

A generic version of a drug used to prevent organ transplant rejection is being recalled because of an unusual problem: Patients may not absorb enough of the ''SangCya oral solution'' if they swallow it with apple juice.
The Food and Drug Administration announced the nationwide recall of SangCya, a generic version of liquid cyclosporine, on Monday.
The brand-name version, Neoral, isn't affected; nor are cyclosporine capsules.
FDA officials urged patients not to alter how they take SangCya until contacting a doctor for advice on switching to another cyclosporine product.
Patients should not panic. Transplant recipients have cyclosporine levels in their blood checked frequently, so people who regularly took SangCya with apple juice would have had their doses increased if doctors spotted too-low drug levels, said FDA generic drugs chief Gary Buehler.
It's the latest controversy over SangCya. Neoral manufacturer Novartis Inc. already has sued the FDA, claiming the government improperly approved the generic drug, and said Monday's recall bolsters that argument.
SangCya's instructions suggest patients mix it in apple juice or orange juice to disguise the bad taste. But a study found volunteers who took SangCya mixed in apple juice absorbed about 20 percent to 30 percent less of the drug than people absorb when taking Neoral with apple juice, Buehler said.
Generic drugs are supposed to be equivalent to their brand-name competitors; hence Monday's recall.
Manufacturer SangStat Medical Corp. actually completed the study before the FDA approved SangCya's sale in 1998, but didn't tell the agency about the results until last week. The FDA is examining why.
A SangStat spokeswoman said the FDA required only one study showing SangCya was equivalent to Neoral, and the company had already submitted a positive study before this one was complete.

China drafts first drug recall system in response to safety scandals

China's pharmaceutical makers would be required to initiate and pay for recalls if their products are found to be harmful under a new drug recall system the government is considering.
The new regulations, if adopted, would be the first to cover drug recalls and would significantly increase the power of the State Food and Drug Administration, the traditionally weak government regulatory agency hit by scandals involving substandard and deadly medicines. In the latest, state media reported Sunday the recall of a leukemia drug blamed for causing leg pains and other problems.
"Producers must take major responsibilities for drug safety," said a draft of the drug recall regulation posted on the agency's Web site late Wednesday to solicit opinions on the rules.
The proposed regulations aim to force Chinese drug producers to issue voluntary recalls, something they have seldom done in the past.
Under the rules, the drug safety agency and its provincial branches would order recalls if companies fail to do so.
Drug companies would have one day to issue a recall after receiving a notice from the government that a product has been found to cause "serious health injuries or death" and three days if the product is only suspected of causing harm, according to the draft.
Drug producers would face fines up to three times the value of the involved drugs and a possible revocation of their licenses if they fail to issue recalls, the draft said.
The proposed recall system for drugs follows new nationwide recall systems for unsafe food and toys that came into effect in late August. Those systems, put in place by the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection, and Quarantine, follow an earlier system set up for defective cars in 2005.

The FDA warned Omnicare for inadequate quality control systems for the fifth time in 11 years, causing the company to recall its products and close its drug repackaging facility.
Omnicare's drug repackaging facility, Heartland Repack Services, distributes drugs through pharmacy services to Omnicare nursing homes, assisted living facilities and other facilities, the warning letter said. During inspections June 27-Aug. 11, 2006, the agency found the drugs were adulterated because of current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) violations with the repackaging system, according to the letter, which was sent Jan. 11 and posted to the FDA website Jan. 30.
Omnicare has begun corrective actions, including recalling all affected products, temporarily closing the facility and hiring outside consultants, the letter said. Omnicare has performed seven recalls since last June, the agency added.
Although Omnicare has begun corrective actions, the FDA said it sent the letter because the corrective actions are not complete, and because of Omnicare's history of cGMP violations noted in inspections in 1996, 1997, 2004 and 2006. Also, the violations are very serious and pose a significant risk to consumers, the FDA added.
The company intends to formally reply to the FDA within the 15 working days the agency requested, company spokesman Andy Brimmer said. Omnicare will also relocate its repackaging operations to a new facility, which will open once the company meets all safety and compliance requirements, he added.
The warning letter can be seen at www.fda.gov/foi/warning_letters/g6208d.pdf (           http://www.fda.gov/foi/warning_letters/g6208d.pdf).

A drug distributor is recalling a batch of the prescription antibiotic Vantin because it may actually contain a heart medication, posing a risk of death if patients swallow the wrong drug.
Consumers who have Vantin tablets dispensed after Dec. 12 should immediately check with their pharmacists to see if they have the recalled version, the Food and Drug Administration said.
The recall comes after a pharmacist discovered Lanoxin, a brand of the heart medication digoxin, inside a bottle labeled as Vantin.
Some pharmacists rebottle all medicines before dispensing them to consumers and presumably would also have spotted the mix-up, as the drugs look nothing alike. But other pharmacists just put the patient's dosage instructions on the manufacturer's bottle before dispensing.
Tablets of Vantin, the antibiotic, are football-shaped, orange-red and embossed with a "U" and "3618." Lanoxin tablets are round, white and embossed "LANOXIN" and "X3A."
Recalled are 420 bottles shipped to pharmacies and distributors in the Northeast, Kentucky, Minnesota, Missouri and South Dakota beginning Dec. 12.
The recalled bottles may identify manufacturer Pharmacia & Upjohn Co. or Graham Development Inc., the drug repackaging company that issued the recall. Pharmacists may spot the label code NDC #0009-3618-01, Lot K08210301, expiration 04/2008.
Some bottles dispensed to consumers, however, may bear none of that coding.

FDA recalls drug made in N. Idaho;  Product made in Rathdrum home without permit, say city officials

A drug that prompted an urgent health warning from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration was made in the spare room of a home here, says a former company employee.
The company that made the drug lacked a permit to do so, say Rathdrum city officials.
The FDA issued a recall last month for alternative drugs made by Rathdrum's Amram Inc. because one of its drugs caused illnesses in three Philadelphia patients last month. In those cases, the gout drug colchicine was 10 times more potent than it should have been, the FDA said.
The agency inspected Amram in Rathdrum and found it was violating FDA requirements for making drugs; for example, it was not using sterile water.
''These requirements help ensure that drug products are safe and effective,'' the FDA said in a statement. ''The violations FDA found demonstrate that the products lack assurance of sterility and potency.''
Amram sold its drugs to Phyne Pharmaceuticals, based in Scottsdale, Ariz. The FDA also said Phyne delayed its recall of Amram's drugs.
Phyne officials, however, say both companies did everything they could to expedite recalls. The FDA clogged the process, they claim.
''The only delay has been the FDA micromanaging the wording of the recall letter and postcard,'' said Holly Gieszl, a Phoenix attorney for Phyne.
But she also made this point clear:
''This is not Phyne's recall. This is Amram's recall.''
According to state records, Amram is owned by George and Edith Crawford. The house they listed as their business address has since been sold to Spirit Lake Police Chief Douglas Camster.
Camster said he bought the house in June from Edith Crawford.
''There was nothing here,'' Camster said. ''There was no indication of anything but a normal household.''
That's because the Crawfords didn't make Amram drugs at that house, said Melanie Schumacher, a former Amram employee. Her husband, Richard Schumacher, is on Amram's board of directors. He is Edith Crawford's brother.
''It was in someone's house,'' said Melanie Schumacher, who refused to reveal the location of Amram's Rathdrum lab or the homeowner's name. She said the homeowner had no idea the Crawfords had converted an addition he had built for his parents into a lab.
Shumacher described the room where the drugs were made as white and sterile. She defended Amram and its owners, saying the only problem the company had was with one drug - colchicine.
The real culprit, Shumacher said, is the FDA.
''(The Crawfords) are definitely getting screwed over,'' Schumacher said. She said the FDA has long been on a witch hunt for Phyne.
''I think they're just using Amram as a tool.''
Phyne's past president, James Critchlow, said he knew nothing of the Crawfords using a home to make drugs, only that he had been assured of the operation's quality.
''I don't see anything wrong with it,'' Critchlow said. ''As long as it was a sterile operation. That was the whole problem.''
FDA rules weren't the only ones allegedly broken.
Rathdrum doesn't allow such businesses in homes without a conditional use permits, said Jan Hale, city planning administrator.
The Crawfords didn't seek a conditional use permit, Hale said.
''If they were operating out of a home,'' she said, ''they were operating illegally.''
Even with a license, a home-based lab is a bad idea, said Al Czap, chief executive officer of Thorne Research. The Sandpoint company makes hypoallergenic products for physicians and pharmacies.
''It's not something I would undertake, by any means,'' Czap said. Injectable drugs need filtration, sterilization and cross contamination, he said. ''Any one of those things is not something I'd be doing out of the back of a house.''
Contacted at a new home in Coeur d'Alene, Edith Crawford refused to comment.
Shumacher said the Crawfords have been bombarded with calls from reporters across the country.
''The FDA is out for blood,'' Schumacher said. ''They're not big on alternative medicine, and the drug companies are pushing them to do it.''

Batch of antibiotic recalled for possible drug mix-up

A drug distributor is recalling a batch of the prescription antibiotic Vantin because it may actually contain a heart medication, posing a risk of death if patients swallow the wrong drug.
Consumers who have Vantin tablets dispensed after Dec. 12 should immediately check with their pharmacists to see if they have the recalled version, the Food and Drug Administration said.
The recall comes after a pharmacist discovered Lanoxin, a brand of the heart medication digoxin, inside a bottle labeled as Vantin.
Some pharmacists rebottle all medicines before dispensing them to consumers and presumably would also have spotted the mix-up, as the drugs look nothing alike. But other pharmacists just put the patient's dosage instructions on the manufacturer's bottle before dispensing.
Tablets of Vantin, the antibiotic, are football-shaped, orange-red and embossed with a "U" and "3618." Lanoxin tablets are round, white and embossed "LANOXIN" and "X3A."
Recalled are 420 bottles shipped to pharmacies and distributors in the Northeast, Kentucky, Minnesota, Missouri and South Dakota beginning Dec. 12.
The recalled bottles may identify manufacturer Pharmacia & Upjohn Co. or Graham Development Inc., the drug repackaging company that issued the recall. Pharmacists may spot the label code NDC #0009-3618-01, Lot K08210301, expiration 04/2008.
Some bottles dispensed to consumers, however, may bear none of that coding.

Coroner reviewing deaths after recall of arthritis drug

The Butler County coroner has reviewed more than 600 deaths in the last two years to determine if the people were taking Vioxx, the popular arthritis drug recalled on evidence it increased the risk of heart attack or stroke.
In part because of Dr. Richard Burkhardt's review, a North American medical examiners association plans to ask its members if they're getting inquiries about the drug.
"I'm sure we're going to start getting calls all over the United States from people saying, 'My loved one was taking this drug,"' said Al Garnick, deputy coroner in Kentucky's Campbell County and president of the International Association of Coroners and Medical Examiners.
Burkhardt and Garnick said it would be difficult to prove if Vioxx had a direct link to a death.
"It's one thing to say that a person was prescribed Vioxx," Burkhardt said Friday. "It's another to say it caused their death."
Burkhardt said he reviewed the old cases to ensure he didn't miss anything. He found seven documented Vioxx prescriptions. Two of those deaths were caused by problems with the heart or blood vessels.
Garnick said autopsy reports and testimony by medical examiners are likely to be part of hundreds of lawsuits expected to be filed by patients against Vioxx maker Merck & Co.
The association also might ask members in Canada, Mexico and the United States to report concerns about five other drugs a U.S. Food and Drug Administration official told Congress might be unsafe: Accutane acne medication, weight-loss aid Meridia, anti-cholesterol drug Crestor, Bextra pain reliever and Serevent asthma medication.

Alamo family suing makers of recalled diabetes drug

A jury deliberated Friday on a $42 million lawsuit the family of Beatrice Herrera of Alamo filed alleging Warner-Lambert marketed the diabetes drug Rezulin despite knowing it caused liver failure.
The woman's children are blaming Warner-Lambert's drug for liver damage that preceded her death.
"They misrepresented the facts to the FDA regarding the frequency and intensity of the adverse liver reactions," attorney Michael Gallagher said Friday in summarizing the eight-day case.
Documents presented in the case indicated that Warner-Lambert lied to the FDA about the number of people that had elevated liver enzyme levels after taking the drug during the trial period and once the drug was on the market.
"We tried to stress the effectiveness of Rezulin in treating diabetes," Warner-Lambert attorney Jack Urquhart said. "The fact is that the FDA repeatedly examined the drug and continued to find it safe. We also discussed the issue of the fact that the death certificate states that she died of kidney failure."
The plaintiffs are asking the 12-member jury for $25 million for the woman's estate, $2 million for each of her three sons, and $5 million for her each of her two daughters.
The case is one of about a hundred Rezulin-related cases now pending against the drug maker in Texas.
FDA research has linked the drug to 63 deaths from liver failure. According to company documents, Pfizer faces more than 4,200 claims and lawsuits over Rezulin.
While a jury in Houston in December ruled in favor of Warner-Lambert, days later a jury in a Corpus Christi case awarded $43 million for the plaintiffs. Lawyers settled for an undisclosed, reportedly lesser, amount.

Legal uproar over virility supplement; Distributor defies Health Canada order to recall drug

The distributor of an unregulated supplement that contains the active ingredient of the drug Viagra has refused to comply with a Health Canada request to remove it from the market.
Health Canada issued a warning to consumers yesterday, urging them not to purchase or take the pill, marketed under the name Bell Magicc Bullet. A spokeswoman for the department said further action will be taken.
The Canadian Press
The department said the product, which is styled as an herbal supplement, contains the unauthorized chemical ingredient sildenafil, a prescription drug most consumers know by the name Viagra. Nothing on the product's labelling indicates that it contains sildenafil.
As seen on the company's website, the packaging does make the claim the pills are an "all natural herbal supplement to restore male virility," that helps "prevent premature ejaculation" and "works on the first dose."
Health Canada spokeswoman Krista Apse said an unapproved supplement cannot contain a prescription drug. Further, companies selling supplements cannot make unsubstantiated health claims about their products.
"When there's a therapeutic claim … the product has to be approved by Health Canada," Apse said from Ottawa.
She was emphatic when asked if the product would eventually be pulled from Canadian store shelves.
"Yes. Yes. But in the meantime our responsibility is to inform Canadians."
Bell Magicc Bullet is distributed by Bell Distributors Ltd. of Mississauga. The company referred media calls to the company's legal representative, Trueman Tuck, a self-described non-lawyer legal consultant.
He insisted the product does not contain sildenafil, but rather butea superba, "an unpatentable, naturally occurring herb" which has "marker molecules" similar to those of sildenafil.
"It does not contain the drug," Tuck said.
Health Canada insists it does.
"Our tests do show it was sildenafil so, as such, it does require approval from Health Canada before it can be marketed," Apse said.
Bell Distributors has launched a lawsuit against Health Canada, arguing it discriminates against the natural health industry, Tuck revealed, adding the lawsuit names three Health Canada employees who have been involved in the file, claiming they have worked "in a premeditated, malicious manner to destroy my client's financial business."
An initial court date has been set for Dec. 3 in Ontario Superior Court in Belleville, where Tuck's business is based.
Tuck said Bell Distributors has temporarily stopped shipping the product, but will not comply with the Health Canada order. "We will not implement a recall until the science is conclusively proven that their allegation is true, which our science indicates it is not true."
The Health Canada warning notes that inappropriate use of sildenafil can cause severe adverse reactions. It should not be taken by people who are taking any nitrate medication or products which are commonly used for some types of heart disease. The combination of the drugs could lead to life-threatening low blood pressure, it says.
In extremely rare cases, use of the drug could result in penile tissue damage and permanent loss of potency, it notes.
When Health Canada tested the product and found that it contained sildenafil, it approached the company and asked it to withdraw the pills from the market. Voluntary compliance is Health Canada's preferred method of operation, said Apse, who added that refusal to comply is "rare."
In the face of the company's position, the department is taking further "compliance and enforcement actions" to protect consumers.

First lawsuit on recalled cholesterol drug goes to jury

Attorneys for an 82-year-old man whose muscles failed due to Bayer's recalled cholesterol drug Baycol wrapped up their case Thursday, asking a jury for $585 million in damages.
"Bayer is not the type of company to listen to small doses," said attorney Rickey Brantley, part of a team of lawyers representing the former engineer.
Defense attorney Philip Beck in turn told the jury Bayer was fighting the case not because it denied Hollis Haltom had suffered due to Baycol but because the plaintiffs were blaming unrelated diseases on the drug and were calling Bayer evil and malicious.
"When somebody comes into court, asks you for five or six hundred million dollars, I think it's clear for the lawyers on the other side that they need to be looking into what's happening," Beck said.
"He's an 82-year-old man and he's got a history of really remarkable health problems," Beck said. "We don't say that to diminish Mr. Haltom, we say that because what they're saying is it's all because of our drug."
During the trial, attorney Mikal Watts said the data showed Baycol was 79 times more likely to cause the disease than one of its competitors.
The case has gotten national attention as the first of some 7,800 cases now pending against the pharmaceutical to reach a jury.
Pittsburgh-based Bayer has acknowledged the rhabdomyolysis link and said it acted responsibly by withdrawing the drug, known clinically as cerivastatin, in 2001.
But Watts argues Pittsburgh-based Bayer was concerned about profits, and was overly eager to jump into the lucrative U.S. market for the cholesterol-fighting drugs known as statins. About 8 million Americans use statins to lower their risk of heart attacks, making them the third most widely prescribed drug in the nation.
Baycol won FDA approval in 1997 and became the fastest-growing drug in Bayer's history. By the time it was pulled, it was Bayer's No. 3 seller, expected to earn some $720 million that year with 6 million patients worldwide, including 700,000 in the United States.
Beck said Bayer's case showed the company worked with the FDA to make sure Baycol was used safely.
The pharmaceutical giant has paid $125 million to settle about 450 cases, and investors are clearly worried. The U.S.-traded stock of German parent Bayer AG has fallen about one-fourth since the Texas trial began.
Wednesday, Bayer announced that U.S. shareholders filed a lawsuit against the Bayer AG, the pharmaceutical's German parent company, seeking damages for the fall in its share price caused by the failed Baycol.
The lawsuit claims that current Chief Executive Werner Wenning and former CEO Manfred Schneider withheld or misrepresented information on Baycol. It also alleges violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Bayer didn't disclose which law firm was handling the case but said the suit was filed in federal court in New York.

Herbal 'wakeup' drug recalled

Health Canada has issued a voluntary recall for a popular herbal drug commonly used by people who want to stay awake.
The recall was issued yesterday for products containing more than a certain amount of ephedra or ephedrine, and products that combine either of those with caffeine or other stimulants.
The products can lead to strokes, heart attacks, irregular heart rate, seizures and psychoses. They have been linked to deaths in Canada and the U.S.
The Hamilton Spectator
Hundreds of the products are readily available over the counter at such places as health food stores, fitness clubs and even truck stops.
Health Canada says it's gathered enough evidence in a study over the past seven months to believe they're not safe.
"These products pose an unacceptable risk," said Dr. Brian Gillespie, senior medical adviser and acting director of Health Canada's bureau of pharmaceutical assessment.
"Some of them are being imported. We just don't know what they are."
Gillespie said a recent death of an Ontario woman was attributed to such products.
Health Canada issued an advisory in 1997 and again last June, when a study of the effects of the drugs was initiated. The study's results just came in, prompting the voluntary recall.
"I guess we should pull it off the shelf," said Michael Granat, the owner of a Westdale health food store. "There's always been a concern there."
Granat said he'll stop selling ephedra products until he finds out more.
Health Canada has asked Canadian manufactures, distributors and importers to stop selling the products and recall the ones they have. Customs officers have also been asked to seize products coming into Canada.
The voluntary recall is aimed at products:
* With a dose per unit of more than eight milligrams of ephedrine.
* That recommend a single dose greater than eight milligrams or more than 32 milligrams a day.
* That combine ephedrine with stimulants such as caffeine.
* That claim to aid appetite suppression, promote weight loss, enhance metabolism, increase exercise tolerance, aid body-building, and cause euphoria or other stimulative effects.
Products containing ephedra which are marketed as traditional medicine will continue to be available, provided they do not exceed the doses outlined.
Health Canada plans to send inspectors out in the next six months to determine if recalled products are off store shelves.
"If they're not disappearing off shelves, then we will take other regulatory measures," Gillespie said.

Patients Nervous After Drug Recall

When the cholesterol-lowering drug Baycol was pulled off the market three weeks ago, Joan Gedies' doctor prescribed another, similar medication. But Gedies hasn't filled her prescription yet.
Like many other patients, Gedies is suddenly nervous about taking any of the popular medications in the family of drugs called statins, even though they have been shown to dramatically lower cholesterol and reduce the risk of heart attack.
Doctors say they have been swamped with calls from patients since Bayer Pharmaceutical recalled Baycol, which has been linked to deadly muscle destruction.
"I've had patients call me who I haven't seen in three years who have been on a statin. A lot of these people wonder whether they should continue taking the drug in view of this red flag," said Dr. Richard Nesto, chairman of cardiovascular medicine at the Lahey Clinic in Burlington.
Bayer recalled the drug Aug. 8 after it was linked to 31 U.S. deaths and at least nine more abroad. About 700,000 Americans were taking the drug.
Baycol was tied to rhabdomyolysis, a life-threatening condition in which muscle cells are destroyed and released into the bloodstream. The condition, which can cause extreme muscle pain, is occasionally so severe that patients develop potentially fatal kidney failure.
Doctors across the country have been busy reassuring their patients that the other popular statins - Lipitor, Zocor, Mevacor, Pravachol and Lescol - are safe.
"We want to reassure patients that statins have proven to be safe and very effective drugs, and we urge patients who are taking a statin and who have had no side effects to continue taking the drug and to consult their physicians," said American College of Cardiology president Dr. Douglas P. Zipes.
Still, the recall has put some patients on edge.
"It just leaves you worried about statins," said Gedies, 68, of Beverly, who is diabetic. "But I've been told that even though I'm eating as carefully as I can … that it would be hard for me without one of these drugs to get my cholesterol down."
In Phoenix, cardiologist Dr. Bruce Peek has gotten calls from about 20 worried patients. In Miami, Dr. Ted Feldman has heard from more than 100. "People are freaking out," Feldman said.
Feldman said he tells his patients that the dangerous side effects linked to Baycol have been found in extremely small numbers in the other statins.
"Just because you have problem with a Ford Explorer, that doesn't mean that everyone should stop driving a car," he said.
Doctors are warning patients against going off cholesterol medication altogether and are urging them to switch to one of the other statins, which they insist have very low risks and can have lifesaving benefits.
"The reason we give them the medicine in the first place is because the benefit of taking the medicine far outweighs the risks," said Dr. Charles Schulman, a cardiologist from suburban Boston.
Some patients are taking the Baycol recall in stride.
Tina Morgese, 75, a retired secretary from Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., has been on Lipitor for about 18 months. She said she is not about to stop taking the drug, which has lowered her cholesterol significantly.
"I just went in for a checkup this week and it is normal," she said. "It helped me out right away and I've had no bad side effects."
Bob Richman, 65, of Winthrop, had been on Baycol since he had a heart attack three years ago. He said he is not afraid to switch to another statin.
"No matter what you do today, no matter what you eat or what you try, somebody is telling you that one out of 10 people are going to get this or one out of 100 people are going to get that," he said. "If you sit and worry about it, you'll spend the rest of your life worrying about it."
Drug companies are now trying to get former Baycol users to switch to their statins.
Bristol-Myers Squibb took out full-page ads in The New York Times, USA Today and The Philadelphia Inquirer, offering a free, one-month supply of Pravachol. Merck took out a full-page ad in The Wall Street Journal with a headline alerting Baycol users to its drug Zocor.
Pfizer, which makes Lipitor, the market leader, said it will highlight Lipitor's safety record and offer free cholesterol screenings around the country.

Drug recall causes panic

A drug company's decision to pull the cholesterol-lowering drug Baycol off the market Wednesday has caused a flurry of calls to doctors offices and some panic.
Baycol has been linked to one death and 31 cases of muscle weakness in Canadian users. Three Cambridge area people have been hospitalized after taking the medication, but are now recovered. And there have been reports in the U.S. that the drug has been linked to more than 30 deaths.
The side-effects, known as rhabdomyolyis, causes inflammation of the muscles. The muscles release enzymes that go out into the blood stream which can affect other organs.
Symptoms include muscle cramps and weakness, fever, malaise, fatigue, nausea and vomiting.
The worldwide withdrawal by Bayer Pharmaceutical Co. followed increasing reports of the drug's side-effects, especially in patients who have been taking Gemfibrozil, another cholesterol-lowering drug, at the same time.
Doctor A. Shekhar Pandey, a cardiologist with Cambridge Memorial Hospital is concerned that people are panicking. The removal of Baycol from the shelves doesn't impact other cholesterol-lowering drugs, he said.
"People using Baycol shouldn't necessarily stop taking the drug immediately. It should be approached systematically."
Pandey wants patients who are using this drug to contact their physicians so they can have their blood checked and their condition assessed.
Physicians may then switch patients to an appropriate cholesterol-lowering drug.
Pandey did say that patients taking Baycol who experience the side-effects should be seen more urgently.
Pandey said the three Cambridge residents were hospitalized, treated and are doing well.
Despite the problems with Baycol, Pandey emphasized the value of other cholesterol-lowering drugs, adding they are very valuable drugs that help save lives.
Baycol is not on the list of drugs used by Cambridge Memorial Hospital, said Caroline Oliver, hospital spokeswoman. CMH uses Atorvastatin, a generic cholesterol-lowering drug. However, Oliver said she knew of three patients that were using Baycol upon their physicians' request who have already been contacted by their physicians.
Pandey said at his private practice the phone calls about Baycol have been non-stop. "We have calls from people who are not even on it."
Patients may be reimbursed for their Baycol prescriptions from local pharmacies.
People can also contact Bayer Canada at 1-800-265-7382.

Closing arguments in first lawsuit on recalled cholesterol drug

Attorneys for an 82-year-old man whose muscles failed due to Bayer's recalled cholesterol drug Baycol wrapped up their case Thursday, asking a jury for $558 million in damages, including $500 million punitive.
"Bayer is not the type of company to listen to small doses," said attorney Rickey Brantley, part of a team of lawyers representing the former engineer.
Defense attorney Philip Beck in turn told the jury Bayer was fighting the case not because it denied Hollis Haltom had suffered due to Baycol but because the plaintiffs were blaming unrelated diseases on the drug and were calling Bayer evil and malicious.
"When somebody comes into court, asks you for five or six hundred million dollars, I think it's clear for the lawyers on the other side that they need to be looking into what's happening," Beck said.
"He's an 82-year-old man and he's got a history of really remarkable health problems," Beck said. "We don't say that to diminish Mr. Haltom, we say that because what they're saying is it's all because of our drug."
A doctor hired by Bayer found Haltom suffered numerous disorders, including diabetes and vascular problems that meant blood was not nourishing nerve endings in the muscles.
The case has gotten national attention as the first of some 7,800 cases now pending against the pharmaceutical to reach a jury and because it has uncovered a trove of e-mails and memos showing what appears to be a company cover-up.
Pittsburgh-based Bayer has acknowledged the link to rhabdomyolysis, a muscle-wasting disease, and said it acted responsibly by withdrawing the drug, known clinically as cerivastatin, in 2001.
Since the trial began Feb. 18, Beck, an outside attorney, has argued that the plaintiffs have taken snippets of e-mails and other internal documents out of context - a move he compared Thursday to throwing eggs against a wall that he as defense now had to pick off.
Bayer's defense has been to show more context from the documents in an attempt to prove Bayer told sales representatives and doctors that tests showed the drug could not be combined with certain others and could be dangerous if started at a high dose.
Haltom started on an .8 dose, which company documents show boosted revenue dramatically over the .4 dose, the other available.
Beck pointed out a seven-word Bayer document which he said was misused to make Bayer look callous.
The document's "Dig, Throw (the corpse), Cover (with sand)" missive applied to the drug, he said, not the victims.
"They're trying to inflame you," he said. "To try to get you mad at us because of this … is not right."
Throughout the trial, plaintiff attorney Mikal Watts argued Bayer was concerned about profits, and was overly eager to jump into the lucrative U.S. market for the cholesterol-fighting drugs known as statins. About 8 million Americans use statins to lower their risk of heart attacks, making them the third most widely prescribed drug in the nation.
Watts said that data doctors provide to the Food and Drug Administration showed Baycol was 79 times more likely to cause the disease than one of its competitors. The internal dialogue proves the company knew it long before the recall, he said.
"Try as he might, as slick as he is, as good as he is, he cannot eat all this paper," he said of Beck.
Thursday's courtroom was packed in anticipation of closing arguments; the jury was to begin deliberating the nine-question charge at 9 a.m. Friday.
Baycol won FDA approval in 1997 and became the fastest-growing drug in Bayer's history. By the time it was pulled, it was Bayer's No. 3 seller, expected to earn some $720 million that year with 6 million patients worldwide, including 700,000 in the United States.
Beck said Bayer's case showed the company worked with the FDA to make sure Baycol was used safely.
The pharmaceutical giant has paid $125 million to settle about 450 cases, and investors are clearly worried. The U.S.-traded stock of German parent Bayer AG has fallen about one-fourth since the Texas trial began.
Wednesday, Bayer announced that U.S. shareholders filed a lawsuit against the Bayer AG, the pharmaceutical's German parent company, seeking damages for the fall in its share price caused by the failed Baycol.
The lawsuit claims that current Chief Executive Werner Wenning and former CEO Manfred Schneider withheld or misrepresented information on Baycol. It also alleges violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Bayer didn't disclose which law firm was handling the case but said the suit was filed in federal court in New York.

Massive drug recall spurs questions

A small New Jersey company is at the center of one of the biggest drug recalls ever, and a month after it began, little is clear about why millions of doses were suddenly pulled off the market.
Able Laboratories, a growing maker of generic prescription drugs, recalled all of its products on May 23, saying deficiencies in its testing procedures might have resulted in "sub or super potent" drugs.
The Food and Drug Administration says millions of doses were likely in the market. "We're getting reports of a large number of products being recalled, literally truckloads," says Margaret Glavin, associate commissioner at the FDA.
Able produces about 30 generic drugs, some well known, including generic versions of the painkiller Vicodin, Tylenol with codeine, blood-pressure drug Atenolol and nitroglycerin tablets for chest pain.
Promethazine, an antihistamine, is its top seller, with more than 50% of the generic U.S. market.
The recall -- highly unusual because all products were involved -- has devastated Able and shareholders. Able's stock has dropped 86% since mid-May.
The recall is also likely to raise questions for the FDA. Able passed 11 FDA plant inspections in the past three years, the FDA says. Never did the FDA raise what it considered to be a serious concern about the company's manufacturing processes.
When all is known, "The FDA might end up with egg on its face," says Sharon di Stefano, stock analyst with Sky Capital. "The recall was unprecedented and shocking."
The recall's exact size won't be known for weeks or months. Able produced 1.3 billion tablets, capsules and suppositories last year.
Drugs made earlier might be in the market, too, if they haven't expired.
The FDA and the company advise consumers to keep taking the drugs until they get new medications from their doctors. A sudden stop could do more harm than taking a possibly compromised drug, they say.
"The drugs might be fine, but you just don't know," says Sheila Weiss Smith, associate professor in the University of Maryland's school of pharmacy.
Manufacturing ends
Since the recall, Able, with sales of $103million last year, has halted manufacturing and laid off more than half its 400 employees. Its CEO and co-founder, Jay Wadekar, has resigned, and the company has given no assurance as to when, or if, it'll resume production.
"I've never heard of a recall resulting in the shutdown of an entire company," Smith says. "It's hard to tell if this was a new problem or something that had been going on for a long time."
The company has refused to comment. Wadekar could not be reached. Calls to four Able board members were not returned. At least eight shareholder lawsuits have been filed since the recall's announcement.
"The board is diligently working to solve the problem," says company adviser Mallory Factor, who refused to comment further.
The first hints of trouble emerged in mid-May, when Able announced an internal review after recalling three products in the first quarter. Days later, Able said some laboratory testing practices showed "departures from standard operating procedures."
The full recall came four days later.
It was also three months after the FDA had inspected the South Plainfield, N.J., plant, where most of Able's production was done. The February inspection, designed to check the practices that Able later said were lacking, turned up nothing that would warrant an FDA warning letter, the FDA says. Warning letters are made public and demand corrections under threat of more serious sanctions.
Five of the FDA's 11 Able inspections since early 2002 looked at the company's manufacturing practices, the FDA says. The others focused on new-product approvals, so were narrower in scope.
In 2004, Able was cited for failing to tell the FDA about 27 consumers who had adverse reactions after taking Able-made drugs. Seven other drugmakers received warning letters for similar issues since 2002, FDA records show.
While Able repeatedly passed FDA muster in recent years, it hasn't always.
In 1991, the FDA charged Able with failing to comply with good manufacturing practices, and the company operated under a consent decree for 10 years.
Able has also had at least 12 product recalls since 1991, the FDA website says. The far bigger generic-drug maker Mylan Laboratories, with $1.3 billion in fiscal 2005 sales, has never had a product recall due to its own error, it says.
Able's recalls show that the company struggled with a broad range of problems:
*In 1993, it recalled non-prescription aspirin and a vegetable laxative that were feared subpotent, and non-prescription cold tablets that had longer expiration dates than allowed.
*In 2001, it recalled 126,000 nitroglycerin tablets, taken for chest pain, because they were mislabeled in terms of strength.
*This year, it recalled 3 million Atenolol tablets, distributed in Florida and Ohio, because of subpotency concerns; 75,000 mislabeled bottles of antibiotic Metronidazole capsules; and 2 million suppositories made of Promethazine Hydrochloride, used to treat allergies and control nausea. The suppositories failed stability tests, which include purity and efficacy.
FDA steps in
The FDA says it's investigating what went wrong at Able.
The company's two biggest distributors, McKesson and Cardinal Health, say they've returned all of their product. They handle about 29% of Able's production.
The recall has also ensnared other companies. Quality Care Products of Michigan bought Able drugs and sold them under the Quality name. Last week, it put out its own recall notice.
It was the first that co-owner and CEO Mike Holmes remembers doing in years -- and the first for a manufacturer's entire product line.
The recall won't cost his company much, Holmes says, but "you never want to have your company name in a recall even though we had nothing to do with it."
While Quality expects little sting from the event, Able's future is uncertain.
In addition to suspending manufacturing, Able withdrew seven new drug applications pending at the FDA because it said it can no longer rely on the data upon which they were based.
That is a sharp reversal from the direction Able had been heading. Since 2001, it was FDA-approved to make 25 new drugs. It is close to opening a new plant that could boost production at least 300%.
The trouble that struck the company was unseen on May 5 when Able said first-quarter profit was up 75%.
Several stock analysts, on a conference call with company executives the next day, complimented the strong quarter.
Able's downfall was swift
May 5: Able announces first-quarter revenue up 43% to $30.7 million. Damage was "fairly contained," CEO says in next-day conference call when questioned about a February product recall. "I thought to myself, 'Oh, no big deal,'" says Tom Bishop, editor of investment newsletter BI Research.
May 10: Able files a report with Securities and Exchange Commission. It says company is probing operating practices because of three recent product recalls.
May 19: Able says it suspended shipments, found "departures from standard operating procedures" in lab testing and that the CEO was resigning.
May 23: Able announces total recall.
May 25: Able tells customers what to do with their drugs.
June 9: Able announces more job cuts, in addition to the 200 announced on May 27.
Check your drugs
Consumers who have drugs made by Able Laboratories should return them to their pharmacies, the FDA says.

China launches drug recall system putting pressure on companies to withdraw faulty drugs

China launched a nationwide recall system Wednesday that shifts responsibility to companies to recall harmful drugs, a day after U.S. and Chinese officials signed an agreement on the safety of medicine and medical devices.
The recall plan will place Chinese-made drugs and imported drugs in three classes according to their possible danger to people's health, a State Food and Drug Administration official said at a news conference.
Each will have to be recalled within different timeframes, ranging from 24 hours for the most serious drugs, to 72 hours for those deemed less life-threatening.
The global pharmaceutical industry increasingly uses drugs either made or containing ingredients sourced in China. That has put more attention on China to restore confidence in its manufacturing capabilities after a series of products ranging from toys to toothpaste to a pet food ingredients were found to contain poisonous products earlier in the summer.
The new recall rule puts the onus on companies to have systems in place to recall bad drugs within the set time period and take responsibility to alert the government of any noticeable bad reactions on patients that are caused by their drugs. They are also encouraged to carry out voluntary recalls and may be excused punishment if they do.
Drug distributors and medical institutes must also notify authorities of any safety risk to a particular drug.
Unlike in the U.S. where drug recalls by companies are voluntary, the Chinese government can also order a compulsory recall of bad drugs. A fine three times the total value of the recalled drugs will also be levied on a company which did not voluntarily recall a bad drug.
"We hope that government and companies can cooperate to enhance and perfect the establishment of the system and not just rely on the government's information. The companies should make efforts to monitor drug reactions," State Food and Drug Administration Deputy Director Yan Jiangying said.
The recall doesn't deal with counterfeit drugs, which are covered under a different law.
Under the agreement made with the U.S. Tuesday, the State Food and Drug Administration will require firms manufacturing specific drugs and medical devices to register with it.
The agreement covers 10 exports to the U.S., and eight products the Chinese want to import. This is just a sliver of China's health-related exports to the U.S. but the list may be expanded, Yan said.
The list for the U.S. includes drugs to treat impotence, dietary supplements, glucose test strips and condoms.
On China's list is drugs to treat AIDS, hepatitis and insulin, as well as pacemakers.

Cleviprex injectable drug lots recalled

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced the recall of 11 lots of Cleviprex, an injectable emulsion drug, because of possible contamination.
The FDA said The Medicines Company of Parsippany, N.J., initiated the voluntary recall after learning the drug (clevidipine) might be contaminated with a visible particulate matter.
Cleviprex is used for rapidly reducing blood pressure and maintaining blood pressure control.
"The affected Cleviprex lots are 61-978-DW, 61-979-DW and 61-980-DW, Exp. 01/2010; 68-404-DJ, 68-405-DJ and 68-406-DJ, Exp. 08/2010; 69-830-DJ, 63-385-DJ, 63-386-DJ, and 63-266-DJ, Exp 03/2011; and 64-453-DJ, Exp. 04/2011," the company said. No other lots are affected by the recall.
The particulate matter comprises sub-visible inert stainless steel particles of about 2.5 microns in length. When present in low numbers as observed, particles of this size are not known to constitute a health hazard, the FDA said. But if the sub-visible particles were to aggregate, or if larger particles were present, then they could become visible and could theoretically reduce blood flow in capillaries, causing mechanical damage to some tissues, or initiating acute or chronic inflammatory reactions, the federal agency said. Reduced blood supply to tissues might lead to ischemia or organ insufficiency in the brain, kidney, liver, heart or lungs.

Merck recalls blockbuster arthritis drug

Pharmaceutical giant Merck & Co. is pulling its blockbuster arthritis drug Vioxx from the market worldwide because new data from a clinical trial found an increased risk of heart attack and stroke.
Whitehouse Station-based Merck said Thursday that data from the trial showed the increased risk of heart attack and other cardiovascular complications began 18 months after patients started taking Vioxx.
The data comes from a three-year study aimed at showing that Vioxx at a 25 milligram dose prevents recurrence of polyps in the colon and rectum. The trial was stopped after Merck discovered the higher heart risk compared to patients taking dummy pills.
"It's a disaster for Merck, coming at the worst time," said independent health care analyst Hemant Shah of HKS & Co. in Warren, N.J.
Vioxx is one of Merck's most important drugs, with $2.5 billion in sales in 2003. But sales dipped 18 percent in the second quarter of this year to $653 million, partly due to increasing concerns about the drug's safety.
"We're taking this action because we believe it best serves the interest of patients," Ray V. Gilmartin, Merck's chairman, president and chief executive officer, said in a prepared statement.
"Although we believe it would have been possible to continue to market Vioxx with labeling that would incorporate these new data, given the availability of alternative therapies and the questions raised by the data, we concluded that a voluntary withdrawal is the responsible course to take," he said.
The analyst Shah said the withdrawal of Vioxx comes "at a time when they really need to get ready for expiration" of its patent for Zocor, a high cholesterol drug which is Merck's top-selling drug. Zocor loses patent protection early in 2006 and sales are expected to plunge when generic competition begins. In an effort to replace those revenues, Merck recently launched a drug with partner Schering-Plough Corp., Vytorin, that combines Zocor and Schering-Plough's Zetia to attack cholesterol levels in two complementary ways.
"This makes it almost inevitable for the company to find a merger partner for them to continue to grow," Shah said.
Merck, the world's third-biggest drug maker, announced the news before the stock market opened. In pre-market activity on the New York Stock Exchange, Merck shares plunged 14.1 percent, or $6.35, to $38.72.
Merck is scheduled to release financial results for the third quarter, which ends today, on Oct. 21.

Herbs With Diabetes Drug Recalled

Two herbal preparations found to contain a blood sugar-lowering drug have been recalled by two California firms, the Food and Drug Administration announced Wednesday.
The recalled products are Dianolyn Capsules, made by Diabetic Capital of Alhambra, Calif., and Dimelstat, manufactured by SciQuest Lab Inc. of Brea, Calif. Both are said to contain ''dangerously high'' amounts of glyburide, a drug used to lower blood sugar.
SciQuest and Diabetic Capital announced the recalls in statements released by the FDA. The announcements are on company letterheads, but they have virtually identical wording and were based on a model drawn up by the FDA, according to agency spokesman Brad Stone.
''People who have low blood sugar or those with diabetes run the risk of serious or life threatening complications if they consume these products,'' the announcements said.
The statements urged consumers to stop using Dianolyn Capsules and Dimelstat and to seek medical advice, ''especially if they are currently being treated with other anti-diabetic drugs or if they have symptoms of fatigue, excessive hunger, profuse sweating, or numbness of extremities.''
Diabetic Capital said it was recalling all Dianolyn Capsules distributed prior to Wednesday. It said the product is sold nationally and promoted in Chinese language radio commercials and newspapers.
Dianolyn Capsules are light brown and packed in blister packs, with 30 capsules per box. The boxes are printed with pictures of a man with green leaves in the background. The label claims the product contains only natural herbal ingredients.
Dimelstat capsules are packaged in a white bottle. Each capsule contains a brown powder and they are sold 60 to the bottle. The product lot number is 0915, the company said. SciQuest sells the product by mail order and through specialty herb stores.
Both companies said consumers could receive refunds if the products are returned to the place of purchase. And both companies claimed there have been no reported illnesses from the products.
The recall action comes just two months after the FDA issued a warning about five other herbal products that contained blood-sugar lowering drugs. That warning came after a diabetic herb user in California suffered hypoglycemia after taking the products.
California investigators found that those five products contained either glyburide or another suger-lowering drug, even though makers of the products said they contained only natural Chinese herbs.

Bayer Issues Partial Drug Recall

Federal regulators said Friday night they are investigating allegations that at least 13 vials of an immune deficiency treatment drug made by Bayer Corp. may have been tampered with by someone outside the company.
Bayer said someone diluted at least 13 vials of its liquid drug Gamimune N with saline. The company is recalling about 8,000 of the vials distributed nationwide, and the Food and Drug Administration is investigating.
Bayer said it knew of no patients harmed by the diluted drug, and was unsure what effects it would have on a patient.
Gamimune N is used by about 20,000 patients with weakened immune systems, including bone marrow transplant recipients.
Bayer said it believes the tampering occurred after the drug left its North Carolina plant and is limited to two lots handled by a single distributor, which the company refused to identify.
"We have really isolated this incident to the two lots," said company vice president Michael Fournel. "We have no reason to believe the other lots are affected."
Bayer makes two million vials of Gamimune N each year.
The FDA said it is comfortable with Bayer's limited recall decision.
"I think at this point the information indicates that the actions taken by Bayer are appropriate," said Steve Masiello, director of the office of compliance and biologics quality.
Bayer said customer complaints earlier this year that their vials of Gamimune N contained uncharacteristically cloudy liquid prompted it to recall one lot on Feb. 1. Fournel said the company has since received 500 vials from that first lot. Several of those vials showed obvious signs of tampering, Fournel said.
Bayer began recalling the second lot Thursday. Fournel said the company waited that long because it didn't conclude until Monday that someone had tampered with the drugs.
Earlier this month, a Kansas City, Mo., pharmacist pleaded guilty to diluting two chemotherapy drugs made by Eli Lilly and Co. and Bristol-Myers Squibb. Prosecutors said Robert Courtney made hundreds of dollars extra per dose.
Pittsburgh-based Bayer Corp. is a subsidiary of German conglomerate Bayer AG. The company voluntarily removed the anti-cholesterol treatment Baycol from the U.S. market last August after the FDA linked it to 31 deaths.

"This makes it almost inevitable for the company to find a merger partner for them to continue to grow," Shah said.
Like Zocor, Vioxx is one of Merck's most important drugs, with $2.5 billion in sales in 2003. But sales dipped 18 percent in the second quarter of this year to $653 million, partly due to increasing concerns.
Merck's announcement stands to benefit rival Pfizer Inc., the world's biggest drugmaker. The two companies have been battling for market share, with Pfizer's Celebrex dominating the market with about $5 billion in U.S. sales alone last year.
"I think Celebrex sales are going to significantly increase," Shah said.
Vioxx, launched in the United States in 1999, and a successor drug called Arcoxia, approved in some other countries and awaiting Food and Drug Administration approval here, are part of a class of anti-inflammatory drugs heavily touted by the pharmaceutical industry as being more effective and having less side effects, particularly on the gastrointestinal system, than older drugs.
Pfizer's Celebrex and its successor drug, Bextra, which already is on the market in the United States, also are in that class, called cox-2 inhibitors.
"This has never been the massive innovation which was promoted to be," Shah said of the drug class. "In terms of pain relief, these drugs are no better than ibuprofen and they cost 10, 15 times more."
He said it is possible the news, along with some prior reports about heart risk and gastrointestinal bleeding linked to the drugs, could push some patients to go back to older, cheaper drugs.
Shah also said physicians prefer ibuprofen more than Celebrex and Vioxx combined.
"We're taking this action because we believe it best serves the interest of patients," Ray V. Gilmartin, Merck's chairman, president and chief executive officer, said in a prepared statement.
"Although we believe it would have been possible to continue to market Vioxx with labeling that would incorporate these new data, given the availability of alternative therapies and the questions raised by the data, we concluded that a voluntary withdrawal is the responsible course to take," he said.
Merck, the world's third-biggest drugmaker, announced the news before the stock market opened. It was holding a 9 a.m. news conference in New York to discuss the findings.
Merck is scheduled to release financial results for the third quarter, which ends today, on Oct. 21.

Heart attack risk prompts recall of arthritis drug

Vioxx, the blockbuster arthritis drug taken by tens of millions of people, was pulled from the market by its maker Thursday after a study found it doubled the risk of heart attacks and strokes.
Experts advised patients to immediately stop taking Vioxx, which was developed in Canada over a period of more than a decade, and talk to their doctors about alternatives.
Mercury news services
"Given the availability of alternative therapies, and the questions raised by the data, we concluded that a voluntary withdrawal is the responsible course to take," said Ray V. Gilmartin, chairman, president and chief executive of Merck & Co.
Health Canada was among the regulatory bodies that approved the drug in 1999. Information from IMS Health, a private organization that tracks drug dispensing trends, shows that there were more than 3.3 million prescriptions for Vioxx in Canada last year -- making it the 10th most prescribed drug in 2003.
The withdrawal marks a serious blow to New Jersey-based Merck, the world's third-largest drug maker. Vioxx accounted for $2.5 billion US in worldwide sales in 2003, and has been taken by 84 million people worldwide since its introduction. An estimated two million people are now using it.
Last year, retail sales of the drug in Canada were $194.5 million.

Altered heparin linked to deaths; Chemical from animal organs found in recalled drug batches

A chemical probably derived from cow trachea and pig ears was used to adulterate batches of the blood-thinning drug heparin that are associated with 19 deaths, according to the Food and Drug Administration.
The heparin, tainted with a cheap substitute that mimicked its effects, was sold by Baxter International, based in Deerfield, Ill., and produced in China. Contaminated lots were recalled on Feb. 28.
The chemical, called over-sulfated chondroitin sulfate, made up from 2% to 50% of the active pharmaceutical ingredient in the recalled heparin, says Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.
"FDA is moving forward to see how and when it was introduced into the supply chain," she says. "We don't know if it was intentional or by accident."
The FDA believes the contaminant was created by adding extra sulfur molecules to chondroitin sulfate, familiar to Americans as an over-the-counter dietary supplement believed by some to aid joints. It is "abundant and inexpensive," Woodcock says. Made from animal cartilage, chondroitin sulfate by itself does not act as an anti-coagulant. But it appears that by adding sulfur, the chemical mimics the blood-thinning capabilities of heparin enough that it passed basic purity tests at the factory. More sophisticated tests created by the FDA uncovered the contamination after reports of allergic reactions first appeared in January.
Baxter says the contaminant appeared to have been added to crude heparin before it got to Scientific Protein Laboratories of Waunakee, Wis., which refines the heparin for Baxter. Crude heparin comes from the lining of pig intestines. Scientific Protein said in a statement that it found the contaminant in crude heparin from China but not in crude heparin from North America.
The news comes just a year after officials discovered the industrial chemical melamine had been used in China to fake more expensive grain protein exported for use in pet foods. That episode sickened thousands of dogs and cats in the USA and killed hundreds.
David Kessler, former commissioner of the FDA and now a professor of pediatrics at the University of California-San Francisco, says the news shouldn't come as a surprise: China is "as close to an unregulated environment as you can get." In fact, it's a lot like the USA was in 1906, he says -- "that's why we developed an FDA."

Company recalls some drug-coated stents because of potentially deadly problem

Boston Scientific Corp. said Friday it is recalling 200 of its recently approved drug-coated coronary stents because of a malfunction that has been blamed for at least one death.
The medical-equipment maker attributed the malfunction to a manufacturing defect that has since been fixed.
A stent is a wire-mesh tube inserted into a heart artery to keep it propped open after the vessel is cleared of a blockage. Some stents are coated with slow-release drugs to prevent scar tissue from creating a new blockage.
A tiny balloon is used to expand the stent inside the artery. But Boston Scientific said a malfunction can prevent the balloon from deflating after it has been used. That can result in death or require bypass surgery.
Boston Scientific reported one death and 16 serious injuries from such a deflation failure to the Food and Drug Administration. But the company said it found the problem in only two recent manufacturing lots of the Taxus Express2 stents.
The recall does not affect patients who have already received a Taxus stent, because the problem turns up only at the time it is implanted. About 445,000 of the stents have been implanted, spokesman Paul Donovan said.
Boston Scientific said it voluntarily recalled the 200 defective stents after detecting the problem through its quality-control process.
The company is notifying the 99 U.S. hospitals and three Canadian hospitals that have received the recalled stents. Company officials said they did not know whether any of the stents had already been implanted.
Boston Scientific received approval from regulators in March to sell the Taxus in the United States. The stent was launched in Europe in 2003.

Recall of heart drug worries Bakersfield family

May 1--The recall of a popular generic heart drug has at least one Bakersfield family worried about adverse effects.
All lots and strengths of Digitek have been recalled because the pills may contain double the amount of the active ingredient.
Bakersfield resident Donna Jackson heard about the recall Wednesday after she received a phone message from the pharmacy.
Her husband, Weldon, has taken the medicine for the two years since his open heart surgery. It's unknown how long he has taken the defective pills.
"There's no telling how many people have died or have been damaged by it," said Mrs. Jackson, 57, who called The Californian for more information. "This may be the reason he never recovered how he was supposed to."
Digitek is a form of digoxin manufactured by Actavis Group and used to treat heart failure and abnormal heart rhythms.
A news release from Actavis said, "Several reports of illnesses and injuries have been received."
The double strength tablets pose a risk to patients with renal failure, the release said. The defective pills can cause nausea, vomiting, dizziness, low blood pressure, cardiac instability and a slow heart rate. Death can also result.
Considering it was voluntarily recalled Friday afternoon, it's too soon to tell how many people have suffered adverse reactions, said Sandy Walsh, spokeswoman for the Food and Drug Administration. She didn't know how long the defective pills were sold.
Calls to the manufacturer Thursday were not returned.
The products are distributed by Mylan Pharmaceutical, under the "Bertek" label, and by UDL Laboratories, under the "UDL" label, the release said.
Mrs. Jackson found the word "Bertek" on her husband's pill bottle.
Law mandates that the manufacturer be listed on a drug's label, Walsh said. The FDA has inspected the manufacturer's facility since the error was discovered, she said.
Retailers who have this product should return it to the place of purchase, the release said. For medical questions, patients should contact their physicians. While Actavis has 50 percent of the digoxin market, the FDA does not foresee a shortage from other manufacturers, Walsh said.
Any customer inquiries should be addressed to Stericycle customer service at 1-888-276-6166, Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. EST.
For more information about the recall, go to www.actavis.us.
Any adverse reactions or quality problems experienced with this drug should be reported to the FDA's MedWatch Program by phone at 1-800-FDA-1088, by fax at 1-800-FDA-0178 or by mail at MedWatch, FDA, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20852-9787.

Pfizer recalls epilepsy drug defect left some capsules short of medicine.

Apr. 23--Pfizer Inc. has voluntarily recalled 40,000 bottles of its Neurontin epilepsy medication after a manufacturing malfunction caused some of the bottles to contain either empty or partially filled capsules.
Pfizer said it is possible that patients taking Neurontin to control their epilepsy could experience seizures from a missed dose of the product from one of the empty or partially filled capsules.
Pfizer said Friday that only 100-milligram capsules were affected from a specific lot -- 15224V -- distributed in October and November of this past year. Pfizer initially notified pharmacists and its distributors of the recall on Feb. 23. The company issued a press release on Friday as a follow-up to its initial recall.
The New York-based Pfizer, which employs about 6,500 in southeastern Connecticut, also encouraged pharmacists to immediately contact any of their customers using Neurontin to ensure their full awareness of the problem with the one lot of drugs that was distributed only in the United States.
Pfizer officials have been working closely with federal Food and Drug Administration officials throughout the recall process. The company said patients should not stop taking Neurontin before consulting with their physicians.
Neurontin has been approved by the FDA for treatment of partial seizures in adults and children and the drug also is approved for management of the pain that can last one to three months after a patient has shingles. The drug is available in various dosage forms, including tablets, capsules and liquid. During the first quarter of this year, Pfizer said the drug had worldwide sales of $182 million, down significantly from its first-quarter sales in 2004 of $696 million. The drug is one of several Pfizer drugs that have lost their patent exclusivity and now face increasing generic competition.
Pfizer said patients should contact their pharmacists if they believe their prescription for Neurontin was filled between Oct. 1, 2004 and March 15, 2005. In addition, consumers with questions about the recall should call Pfizer at 1-800-438-1985. Pfizer said the recall of the 40,000 bottles of Neurontin would not result in any shortages for the central-nervous system drug.

Giants recall Alfonzo after drug suspension

The Giants recalled former backup catcher Eliezer Alfonzo from Triple-A Fresno on Tuesday, nine days after he completed a 50-game suspension for testing positive for a performance-enhancing substance.
Alfonzo arrived fit, healthy and ready for a clean slate, insisting he never knowingly took steroids but did take medicine in December while home in Venezuela for bronchitis.
"It's just like my career is starting over again," Alfonzo said upon arriving at the ballpark. "Whatever happened happened. It was a mistake I made and I already talked about the situation. Everything is in the past and I will keep my head up. now I feel 100 percent mentally and physically."
He was the first player penalized this year under Major League Baseball's drug program. Alfonzo was batting .316 (25-for-79) with five home runs and 19 RBIS, five doubles and a triple in 20 games for the Grizzlies this year. He was out from April 30 to June 22 and spent his suspension in Fresno working out and lost 15 pounds.
Alfonzo said he spent a month trying to prove that he didn't knowingly take an illegal performance enhancer.
"I didn't do anything and if I did it, I did it without knowing what was going on," he said. "I was sick and took something and maybe that's where the substance came from."
The Giants optioned reserve catcher Steve Holm to Fresno, which was playing in Tucson, Ariz. In addition, the Giants optioned right-handed reliever Billy Sadler to Fresno and brought up right-hander Osiris Matos from Double-A Connecticut. Reliever Vinnie Chulk, designated for assignment last week, cleared waivers and was sent outright to Fresno.
Neither Alfonzo nor Guillermo Rodriguez had strong spring training performances, leaving the Giants in a tough position finding someone to back up starter Bengie Molina. The 29-year-old Alfonzo missed most of last season following knee surgery after making the opening day roster for the first time in his career.
Alfonzo will be used to provide offense off the bench and spell Molina when he needs a break.
"Alfonzo's been catching well down there," manager Bruce Bochy said. "He's earned this. He made a mistake. He paid for it. He served his suspension and I'm sure he learned from it."
Alfonzo was injured in a collision at the plate on June 8, had arthroscopic surgery June 19 and didn't play again until Sept 4. In 2006, Alfonzo finally reached the big leagues after more than a decade in the minors when Mike Matheny was forced to go on the disabled list and ultimately retire because of a concussion.
When his suspension was announced, he immediately issued a public apology.
"I made a mistake, and I want to apologize to my family, my teammates, the fans and the Giants organization," Alfonzo said in a statement released by the club. "I know what I did was wrong, and now I will pay the penalty. As a father, I now have to look my children in the eye and explain to them that I have made a big mistake, one, unfortunately, that they are also going to have to deal with, as well as me."
He played 113 games with the Giants in 2006 and 2007, batting .263 with 13 homers and 45 RBIs.
The Giants said in a statement they also were disappointed to learn about the positive test and that they support baseball's testing program. Alfonzo became the first Giants player to be suspended under the major league drug program that first started suspensions in 2004.
The 28-year-old Holm, who played in Double-A last year, batted .214 with one home run and five RBIs in 38 game for the Giants.

HEART DRUG RECALLED FOR DOSAGE CONCERN

Dozens of local heart patients have been calling their physicians and pharmacists following the voluntary recall of a common heart medication called Digitek.
Manufacturer Actavis Totowa LLC announced the recall April 25 after learning that some Digitek tablets with double the normal thickness had been released commercially, and perhaps contain double the approved level of the active ingredient.
The medication, commonly prescribed for patients with heart failure or heart arrhythmia, is distributed by Mylan Pharmaceuticals under the label "Bertek" and by UDL Laboratories under the label "UDL."
Dr. Srinivas Murali, director of the McGinnis Cardiovascular Institute at Allegheny General Hospital, said the drug is a well-established heart disease therapy but "the thing about this drug is that it has side effects directly related to the dosage."
Symptoms associated with an overdose of Digitek, or digoxin, may include a slowed or irregular heart rate, as well as nausea, vomiting, decreased appetite, dizziness and low blood pressure.
"There can be life-threatening side effects, so one cannot take it lightly," said Dr. Murali.
Particularly vulnerable are those with poor kidney function and the elderly, he added.
A UPMC spokeswoman said no one was available yesterday to comment on the recall.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration says it has received "several" reports of illnesses and injuries to those who have taken the medication, but they have not confirmed those symptoms were caused by an overdose. There have been no reports of deaths.
Dr. Murali said AGH has fielded 50 to 100 phone calls from patients with Digitek prescriptions, but only a couple of them reported minor symptoms such as dizziness.
"Fortunately, as far as I'm aware, we have not seen any serious side effects," said Dr. Murali.
"My sense is that the news got out in a very timely fashion and pharmacists across Western Pennsylvania have been alerted."

The Food and Drug Administration Monday recalled Micronase and Glybueride tablets because of possible fungal contamination. The fungi can cause difficulty in treating infections.
The contaminant was traced to a raw material used in the formulation of the tablets.
The recalled Micronase includes lots 84DWB (1.25 mg, bottle of 100), 91DYR (2.5 mg, bottle of 100), 67FPP (5 mg, bottle of 100), and 42 lots of Glyburide tablets.
Micronase is produced by Pharmacia Corp. and Glyburide by Greenstone Limited. The drugs are used to treat diabetes. FDA said the detected fungi include Paecilomyces, Aspergillus and Penicillium.
Pharmacies and distributors are advised to inventory remaining stocks of the tablets and return them to the two companies. For more information, call 800-323-4204.
ConAgra Dairy Foods of Downers Grove, Ill., has recalled 3,000 pounds of Fleischmann's unsalted stick margarine because it may contain whey, a dairy product that is not listed on the ingredient label. The recalled margarine has a use-by date of Jan. 31, 2002.
The recalled margarine was distributed to retail stores in Maryland, Virginia, Alabama, Ohio, Connecticut, New York, Mississippi, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, Vermont, Maine, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Rhode Island, West Virginia and Michigan.
Consumers who are allergic to dairy products are advised to return the margarine to place of purchase for a full refund. For more information, call 800-257-5594.

Merck's stock plunges after recall of drug Vioxx

   TRENTON, N.J. -- Merck & Co. is pulling its blockbuster Vioxx from the market after new data found the arthritis drug doubled the risk of heart attacks and strokes. Merck's stock plunged almost 27 percent as the pharmaceutical giant said the recall will hurt its earnings.
Merck said Thursday the clinical trial data showed an increased risk of heart attack and other cardiovascular complications 18 months after patients started taking Vioxx, which also is prescribed for acute pain and disorders such as carpal tunnel syndrome.
The three-year study -- aimed at showing that Vioxx could prevent the recurrence of polyps, which can turn cancerous, in the colon and rectum -- was stopped after Merck discovered participants had double the risk of a heart attack compared to those taking a placebo. During the study, 10 patients died, five who had been taking Vioxx and five who took dummy pills.
"It's a disaster for Merck, coming at the worst time," said independent health-care analyst Hemant Shah of HKS & Co. in Warren, N.J.
At least one plaintiffs' attorney announced plans for a class-action lawsuit against Merck. Another claimed to represent 58 patients around the country allegedly harmed by Vioxx, including people who suffered a heart attack, stroke, internal bleeding or kidney failure.
Merck spokesman Tony Plohoros said the company anticipates additional personal injury lawsuits over Vioxx may be filed and will defend them vigorously.
About 2 million people worldwide use Vioxx, Merck said, and 84 million prescriptions have been filled since it came on the market with great fanfare in 1999. It is one of Merck's most important drugs, with $1.8 billion in U.S. sales in 2003 and global sales of $2.5 billion -- 11 percent of the company's $22.49 billion in revenue that year.
But Vioxx sales dipped 18 percent in the second quarter of this year to $653 million, partly due to increasing concerns about an elevated risk of heart complications.
Medical experts advised patients Thursday to stop taking Vioxx and consult their doctor about alternatives.
Merck said the recall will slash about 50 cents to 60 cents a share from its earnings for the rest of this year. That includes foregone sales, writeoffs of inventory held by Merck, customer returns of product previously sold and other costs of the pullback. Merck expects foregone fourth quarter sales of Vioxx of $700 million to $750 million alone.
Merck, based in Whitehouse Station, N.J., had previously been expecting 2004 earnings per share of $3.11 to $3.17.
"We're taking this action because we believe it best serves the interest of patients," Ray V. Gilmartin, Merck's chairman, president and chief executive, said in a statement.
Plohoros said that because of the expected drop in revenues, Merck will shift people who worked on Vioxx to other areas that would increase revenues, but not all would find new jobs. He could not give an estimate on job cuts but said those affected would include scientists who have been doing ongoing studies on Vioxx, sales and marketing staff and manufacturing employees.
"We will not react to this event with short-term actions such as decreased (research and development) spending, across-the-board job reductions or actions like salary freezes that would destroy employee morale," Plohoros said.
Shares in Merck, one of the world's biggest drug makers, plunged $12.07, nearly 27 percent, to close at $33 on the New York Stock Exchange. That wiped out $28 billion in market value. More than 140 million shares were traded, compared to a daily average below 10 million.
Shah said for Merck, the Vioxx withdrawal comes "at a time when they really need to get ready for expiration" of its patent for Zocor, the cholesterol treatment that is the company's top-selling drug.
Zocor loses patent protection early in 2006, and sales are expected to plunge against generic competition. In an effort to replace those revenues, Merck recently launched a drug with Schering-Plough Corp., Vytorin, that combines Zocor and Schering-Plough's Zetia to attack cholesterol levels in two complementary ways.
The Vioxx recall stands to benefit Pfizer Inc., the world's biggest drugmaker. Merck and Pfizer have been battling for market share, with Pfizer's Celebrex arthritis drug dominating the market with about $2.6 billion in U.S. sales alone last year. Pfizer shares were up 35 cents to $30.53 in afternoon trading on the NYSE.
Pfizer issued a statement Thursday citing the "outstanding long-term safety profile" of Celebrex and saying that in a recent FDA-sponsored study of 1.4 million patients, those who received Celebrex demonstrated no increased risk of cardiac trouble.
Vioxx was labeled with a warning about heart risks in 2002 after Merck's own study in 2000 uncovered the increased risk of heart attack and other complications. The Food and Drug Administration has been monitoring problems reported to it since then.
"This is not a total surprise," said Dr. Steven Galson, acting director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.
Dr. Steven Abramson, director of rheumatology at New York University Hospital for Joint Diseases, said "there are very few patients for whom there won't be a good alternative drug."
Besides generic anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen, naproxen and aspirin, those include Celebrex, which Abramson said has not been linked to heart complications.
Celebrex and its successor drug, Bextra, as well as Vioxx and a successor drug called Arcoxia that is awaiting FDA approval, are part of a class of anti-inflammatory drugs touted by the pharmaceutical industry as being more effective and having less side effects, particularly on the gastrointestinal system, than older drugs.
Vioxx's removal will be a blow to hopes that it and other drugs in the class known as COX-2 inhibitors could be used to prevent cancer in people at high risk of developing it. A landmark study in 2002 showed that small, daily doses of aspirin could prevent colon cancer, and studies hinted that COX-2 inhibitors might do the same -- possibly without aspirin's side effects.
All COX-2 inhibitors can raise blood pressure, but Vioxx appears to be the only one that's been linked to higher risk of heart attacks and strokes, Galson said.
Merck is scheduled to release financial results for the third quarter, which ends today, on Oct. 21.

The Bayer pharmaceutical company voluntarily pulled its cholesterol-lowering drug Baycol off the market Wednesday, saying it's been linked to 31 cases of muscle weakness in Canadian users -- including one death.
The worldwide withdrawal follows increasing reports of the drug's side-effects, especially in patients who have been taking gemfibrozil, another cholesterol-lowering drug, at the same time.
Canadian Press
"There's been one death in Canada associated with this combination," said Philip Blake, executive vice-president and general manager of Bayer Healthcare in Canada.
"It's not known whether the death was caused by the combination . . . the patient was taking the combination at the time of death."
Health Canada spokeswoman Roslyn Tremblay said Wednesday that up to the end of June, there were 32 reports of the side-effects -- known as rhabdomyolysis -- linked to Baycol.
Health Canada instructed Bayer to issue a letter to health-care providers about the possible side effects in mid-July, she said.
The drug was approved for use in Canada in February 1998, and 1.3 million total prescriptions have been filled for users since then.
There's a range of symptoms associated with rhabdomyolysis, a condition in which muscle cells are destroyed and released into the bloodstream.
"It shows itself in pain, and it shows itself in basically weakness of action," said Blake. Other symptoms can include tenderness, fever, dark urine, nausea and vomiting.
It's not known exactly how many Canadians are currently taking the drug.
In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday that Baycol has been linked to significantly more fatal cases than its competitors -- 31 deaths the FDA knows about since Baycol was approved for U.S. sale in 1997.

Massive recall takes arthritis drug off shelves

Pharmaceutical giant Merck and Co. ordered its arthritis and acute pain drug Vioxx off the shelves Thursday after clinical trial results pointed to a danger of heart attacks and strokes in longtime users.
The company urged patients to consult their doctors immediately to discuss alternative medications. More than three million prescriptions were written last year in Canada for Vioxx, making it the tenth most common prescription drug.
Merck's stock price fell almost 27 per cent Thursday, stripping $26 billion US off the company's market capitalization and making this recall the most costly in pharmaceutical history.
"We are taking this action because we believe it best serves the interests of patients," said Raymond Gilmartin, Merck's chairman, president and CEO. "Although we believe it would have been possible to continue to market Vioxx with labelling that would incorporate these new data, given the availability of alternative therapies, and the questions raised by the data, we concluded that a voluntary withdrawal is the responsible course to take."
Merck first received those data last Friday, from researchers studying whether Vioxx's anti-inflammatory properties might also prevent the growth of pre-cancerous colon polyps. Instead, they found the drug's blood-thickening properties doubled the risk of strokes and heart attacks among people who had been taking Vioxx for more than 18 months.
The four-year-old clinical trial of 2,600 people was halted, and the company said it consulted with medical experts over the weekend before contacting the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Monday. On Tuesday, the company informed its own board and the FDA of its decision to withdraw the drug.
Thursday, the company's general counsel, Kenneth Frazier, vowed to defend against the lawsuits he expects over the recall.
"Merck did the right thing by promptly reporting these findings to FDA and voluntarily withdrawing the product from the market," said acting FDA commissioner Dr. Lester M. Crawford.
John Fleming, CEO of the Arthritis Society, a Canadian advocacy group, agreed that Merck "deserves credit for making what has to have been a very difficult decision corporately."
But this latest study was not the first time Vioxx has been linked to strokes and heart attacks. In August, an FDA investigator, Dr. David Graham, reported to a conference in France that Vioxx led to a higher risk of heart attack than a comparable drug, Celebrex, which is sold by Merck's rival Pfizer. Merck disagreed with the results.
Even before that, though, in a clinical trial that ended in 2000, Vioxx was shown to cause severe stomach problems and gastro-intestinal bleeding. A link was also drawn to heart attacks, but it was not definitive.
That trial prompted changes to the Vioxx label and a warning from Health Canada for patients with a history of heart disease or hypertension.
Dr. Arthur Bookman, a clinical rheumatologist with Toronto Western Hospital and chairman of the Arthritis Society's medical advisory committee, said Vioxx can alter blood chemistry and "tip the balance in the blood vessels towards clotting," which can be a direct cause of strokes. It also increases salt and water retention, which puts one at greater risk of congestive heart failure, he said.
"People are going to miss this drug, although there are others in the same class that are available to them," he said.
Prime among those is Pfizer's Celebrex, which is also a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, or NSAID.
In response to the recall, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced it will now require longer studies and more safety data before approving any more drugs in the same family as Vioxx. As of Thursday, Health Canada had not made any similar requirements.
The FDA approved Vioxx in May 1999 for the management of menstrual pain and acute pain in adults, and later for the treatment of adult and juvenile arthritis. Health Canada followed suit with its approval in October 1999, but still does not approve it for use by children.
On the New York Stock Exchange Thursday, Merck shares closed down $12.07 a share to $33.00 US.
Shares in Canadian drugmaker Dimethaid Research rose in value by more than one-third Thursday amid expectations that its arthritis lotion will benefit from the troubles of Vioxx.
Dimethaid issued a news release noting that a recent 12-week medical trial on 622 Canadian patients found its Pennsaid ointment -- applied to the site of the pain, instead of swallowed -- "has an overall better safety profile than pills containing the same active ingredient."

Drug recalls slow growth in sales

Prescription drug sales rose 8.3 per cent in 2004, the smallest gain in nine years, hurt by factors including Merck & Co.'s recall of Vioxx and over-the-counter versions of ulcer medicines such as AstraZeneca PLC's Prilosec.
Sales increased to $235.4 billion from $217.3 billion in 2003, IMS Health Inc., a Fairfield, Connecticut-based tracker of prescription-drug data, said in a statement Monday. 
Among other factors crimping growth were a mild flu season, higher consumer co-payments for medicines and safety concerns about antidepressants, IMS said.
Prescription-drug sales will gain less than 10 per cent again this year, IMS said, as managed-care insurers seek new ways to control costs and products such as Pfizer Inc.'s antibiotic Zithromax lose patent protection. The Standard and Poor's 500 Pharmaceuticals Index fell 9.5 per cent last year, led by a 30 per cent decline in Merck shares after the company pulled its painkiller Vioxx because of its link to heart attacks.
"It won't get any easier" for pharmaceutical companies, IMS vice-president Paul Wilson said in the statement. "This year's results will also depend on how consumers, who are becoming more active in managing their health care, exercise their prescription drug choices within managed care and the new Medicare programs."
Drugmakers face the expiration of patents between 2002 and 2007 on products worth $82 billion in sales, or a fifth of the industry's $400 billion annual revenue, according to London consultant Datamonitor PLC.

Drug administration recalls kava products

Drug authorities Thursday called on stores across Australia to clear their shelves of products containing kava, a narcotic used commonly in South Pacific islands.
The federal government said it may ban kava following the recent death of a 51-year-old woman that has been linked to the drug.
The woman died several months ago in the southern city of Melbourne of liver failure. She had been taking a medicine containing kava for four months when she developed liver failure.
Widely used in a ceremonial drink by Pacific Islanders, kava is made from the root of a pepper plant. It is often used in modern alternative medicines to combat stress and insomnia.
"We understand that the woman had been taking several complementary medicines," parliamentary secretary to the minister for health and aging, Trish Worth, said in a statement.
"One product she was taking contained kava in combination with two other herbs. She had been taking this product for only four months before she presented with liver failure and the product is suspected to be the most likely cause for her illness," Worth added.
A string of countries around the world have banned kava, fearing a link between its use and liver problems.
Australia's Therapeutic Goods Administration launched a voluntary recall of all alternative medicines containing kava and asked consumers to throw out any products they have that contain kava.
Worth said the government would await the findings of an inquest into the woman's death and review other nations' policies on kava before deciding whether to ban it.

Boston Scientific recalls some drug-coated stents for potentially deadly problem

Boston Scientific Corp. said Friday it is recalling 200 of its recently approved drug-coated coronary stents because of a malfunction that has been blamed for at least one death.
The medical-device maker said the malfunction involves a small fraction of the nearly half-million of its Taxus stents implanted in heart patients. It blamed the problem on a manufacturing defect that has since been fixed.
Shares of Boston Scientific, the market leader in the drug-coated stent market, fell 3 cents to close at $42.67 Friday on the New York Stock Exchange.
The defect can prevent a tiny balloon from deflating after it is used to expand the stent, a metal-mesh tube inserted into coronary arteries to clear blockages.
Boston Scientific's Taxus Express2 stent is one of two next-generation stents on the market that are coated with slow-release drugs to prevent scar tissue from forming new blockages after surgery.
The company said it reported one death and 16 serious injuries from such deflation failures to the Food and Drug Administration. But the company said it found the problem in only two lots shipped since the stent won FDA clearance for U.S. sales on March 4.
The stent has been on the market in Europe since February 2003, with 445,000 implanted in patients worldwide, Boston Scientific said.
The balloons are intended to deflate so they can more easily be withdrawn from the body during surgery. The failure to deflate can result in death or require coronary artery bypass surgery, the company said.
The recall does not affect patients who have already received a Taxus stent because the problem turns up only during surgery when doctors withdraw the balloon through a flexible plastic tube inserted into the body for the surgery.
"There is no post-procedural problem," said Paul Donovan, a spokesman for Natick-based Boston Scientific. "If you have a Taxus stent today, you are fine."
The company believes the balloon problem was the result of a manufacturing defect involving laser-welding of a stent's balloon to the plastic insertion tube. Boston Scientific won approval from the FDA in May to modify its manufacturing process to prevent further problems, Donovan said.
The company said the balloon problem has been the subject of 30 complaints from doctors.
FDA spokeswoman Sharon Snider said the agency was monitoring the company's voluntary recall. She declined further comment.
John Calcagnini, an industry analyst from CIBC World Markets, said he did not expect the recall to erode Boston Scientific's share of the drug-coated stent market, which is more than 70 percent.
"The product (Taxus) stent is very well-liked by doctors, and this (recall) appears to be a very isolated incident," Calcagnini said.
Boston Scientific said it sent notification about the recall to the 99 U.S. hospitals and three Canadian hospitals that have received shipments of the stent from the recalled lots. Donovan said he did not know whether any of those stents had been implanted.
In a conference call with analysts, Boston Scientific executives said the Taxus yielded $210 million in worldwide sales in June, up from $98 million during its first month on the market in March.
The only other drug-coated stent on the market is Johnson & Johnson's Cypher. Rivals such as Medtronic Corp. and Guidant Corp. hope in the next few years to introduce drug-coated stents they are developing into a global market that some industry estimates project could reach $6 billion by 2006.
J&J's stent also has had problems. In April, the FDA warned the company to quickly resolve problems with testing and documentation on Cypher stents manufactured in five different plants.

Jurors begin deliberations in first trial on recalled cholesterol drug

A jury began deliberating Friday in a globally watched $560 million lawsuit against Bayer Corp. over a cholesterol drug that was pulled from the market after being linked to dozens of deaths.
The lawsuit - brought by Hollis Haltom, an 82-year-old engineer who said a muscle-wasting disease caused by Baycol severely weakened his legs - is the first of about 8,400 cases against Bayer to go to trial.
Haltom's lawyers produced e-mails and internal documents to argue that the pharmaceutical giant failed to adequately warn doctors about the possible side effects of the billion-dollar drug.
Like other plaintiffs, Haltom suffered from a disease called rhabdomyolysis after his doctor suggested he switch to Baycol.
Pittsburgh-based Bayer has acknowledged the link to rhabdomyolysis but said it acted responsibly by withdrawing the drug in 2001 after the Food and Drug Administration linked it to at least 52 deaths worldwide, including 31 in the United States.
Haltom's lawyers said that number has now grown to 100 deaths worldwide.
They asked for $58 million for suffering and $500 million in punitive damages.
In closing arguments, Bayer attorney Philip Beck acknowledged that Haltom suffered because of Baycol but said the elderly man was blaming unrelated diseases on it. A doctor hired by Bayer found Haltom has many disorders, including diabetes and vascular problems.
"He's an 82-year-old man and he's got a history of really remarkable health problems," Beck said.
Bayer also contended that Haltom's lawyers had taken snippets of e-mails and other internal documents out of context.
Baycol won FDA approval in 1997 and became the fastest-growing drug in Bayer's history and the company's No. 3 seller.
Bayer has paid about $140 million to settle more than 500 Baycol cases. The U.S.-traded stock of German parent Bayer AG has fallen about one-fourth since the trial began in mid-February.
On Wednesday, Bayer said U.S. shareholders had sued Bayer AG over the drop.

An organization of Mexican pharmacies said it would stop the sale of 53 over-the-counter medicines Friday, following a U.S. government warning that an ingredient in the products could cause hemorrhagic strokes, especially in young women.
At the request of Mexico's Health Secretariat, the National Association of Pharmacies asked stores Friday to stop selling the products many of them cold remedies and turn them into the government over the next two weeks.
Pharmacies in Costa Rica also announced Friday that they would pull the medicines from stores.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued an unusually strong warning Monday, telling Americans to immediately quit using drugs containing phenylpropanolamine, or PPA, which is found in Dexatrim, Tavist-D and dozens of other over-the-counter medicines.
A number of major U.S. drug store chains recalled products with PPAs this week.
A five-year Yale University study comparing PPA use among stroke survivors with healthy people concluded that PPA increases stroke risk for young women within three days of taking PPA-containing appetite suppressants, or within three days of taking their first-ever PPA dose for any reason. In some cases, using PPA increased stroke risk 12- to 15-fold.
The study didn't find men at risk, but the FDA cautioned that not enough men were studied to draw any conclusions.

FDA waited five days to announce Able Labs' drug recall to the public

BRIAN WILLIAMS, anchor:
And if you were with us Friday evening on this broadcast, then you may recall we reported a piece of news that came into our news room late in the day, just about the time that a lot of Americans were probably starting out on their long holiday weekends. We reported the federal government, the FDA specifically, had ordered one of the nation's biggest manufacturers of generic drugs to withdraw all their products because of manufacturing problems that the FDA had known about for several days. The natural question, why did the government wait to warn the public? Well, that's the question NBC News chief science correspondent Robert Bazell put directly to the FDA today.
ROBERT BAZELL reporting: 
A week ago Monday, Able Laboratories, a big manufacturer of generic drugs, suddenly ordered one of the largest drug recalls in history, all its products, probably affecting millions of people. Today Margaret Galvin, the FDA's head of regulatory affairs, said the company's announcement came as a surprise.
Ms. MARGARET GALVIN: This was a new issue coming up.
BAZELL: So suddenly one day they tell you they're recalling every drug that they make?
Ms. GALVIN: That's right.
BAZELL: And that doesn't--doesn't make--that isn't a big shock?
Ms. GALVIN: That is--it was--it was enormous--enormously concerning to us, yes.
BAZELL: Should the FDA have been surprised? Able Laboratories refused to comment for this story. But the drugs were recalled because of manufacturing problems, and the company has a long history of citations from the FDA. It had recalled at least eight other drugs. And an even bigger question, why did the FDA wait five days to tell the public about the recalled drugs. It only put out a press release and posting on its Internet site after 6:00 PM last Friday, a time guaranteed to get the least public attention. Galvin says the FDA needed the entire week to gather as much information as possible.
By releasing it late on a Friday before a holiday weekend, doesn't it look like you're trying to hide the information?
Ms. GALVIN: If it looks like that, that's not what we were about. What we were about was trying to get information that consumers could use.
BAZELL: A daunting task since the recall covers 46 different drugs, painkillers, anti-inflammatories, and many other kinds in different doses and formulations. Dr. Sydney Wolfe, a consumer advocate and frequent critic of the FDA, says the agency should have acted much faster.
Dr. SYDNEY WOLFE: They should be thinking public health service first, and they should be putting it out at a time when it's going to get the most coverage instead of the least coverage. They didn't do that.
BAZELL: And what should consumers do now? The FDA says people should not suddenly taking any medications but check with their pharmacist or doctor to see if their medication is affected by the recall. Robert Bazell, NBC News, Washington.
WILLIAMS: To help clear this up, there is a full list of the drugs covered by this FDA recall. It's on our Web site, Nightly.MSNBC.com.
We'll be right back here tonight with the once secret White House tapes where we can hear exactly what President Nixon thought of the man we now know as Deep Throat.

Health Canada is advising consumers not to use Salt Spring Herbals Sleep Well Dietary Supplement after a sample was found to contain an undeclared sedative drug.
The drug, estazolam, can become habit-forming within a few months, Health Canada said in an advisory.
Consumers already taking the capsules should consult with a health- care professional before stopping the supplement, since withdrawal symptoms may occur.
A recall of the supplement - advertised as a natural health product to relieve insomnia and restless leg syndrome - was initiated by its Canadian distributor, Salt Spring Herbals of British Columbia.
The most common side-effects associated estazolam-containing products are dizziness and drowsiness. More serious adverse effects include loss of memory, hallucinations, confusion and depression.
Drugs in the same class (benzodiazepine) as estazolam can be prescribed only by a physician, said Health Canada. "Estazolam should not be used by people with an allergy to other benzodiazepines (such as Valium, Restoril and Ativan) or those affected by the neuromuscular disorder myasthenia gravis or sleep apnea."
Estazolam should be used with caution by pregnant women, the elderly and anyone with a history of substance abuse.
Consumers who have purchased Salt Spring Herbals Sleep Well Dietary Supplement capsules should return the product to the place of purchase.
To date, no adverse reactions suspected to be associated with the use of this product have been reported in Canada.
The capsules are not authorized for sale in Canada, although they have been found on the Canadian market. The distributor is recalling the product based on preliminary findings with one package analyzed by Health Canada, and the department is conducting additional tests to determine the source of the undeclared drug.
The advisory does not apply to Nova Sleep Well, a melatonin- containing natural health product, which Health Canada has authorized NHP Research and Consulting Co. of Richmond, B.C., to sell.

Schering-Plough Corp. said Wednesday it is recalling some of its prescription asthma drugs because they might not work.
The recall includes the Proventil and Warrick brands of inhalation aerosols, generic albuterol inhalers, and various doses of Vanceril inhalers made from Sept. 30 1997 to Sept. 30, 1999.
The company said that because of manufacturing problems it identified last year some of the inhalers may not contain any active medicine.
Asthma patients who are using their Proventil or Warrick brand of albuterol inhalers with good results do not need to replace them, regardless of when they were made, the company said.
Schering-Plough refused to say how many drugs it was recalling.
The company had $ 124 million in sales of Vanceril last year in the United States and $ 251 million in sales of Proventil. Vanceril wholesales for roughly $ 50 per prescription. Proventil wholesales for about $ 31 per prescription. Retail prices range 20 percent to 30 percent higher.
Patients with Proventil or Warrick brands of inhalers that have never been used and are covered by the recall should return them to their pharmacies. Patients with affected Vanceril inhalers covered by the recall also should return them to their pharmacies, it said.
The recall was ordered in conjunction with the Food and Drug Administration.
For information, patients can call the company at (800) 621-9760.

Kinney Drugs recalls store brand water

Kinney Drugs has implemented a voluntary recall of all sizes of the drug store chain's brand of water because it contained elevated levels of bromate.
The affected product has a sell-by date between June 27, 2008 and Aug. 4, 2008. Kinney officials said the water was removed from the drug store chain's shelves on Aug. 23 and destroyed, and extra warehouse stock was returned to the manufacturer, Mayer Bros. of West Seneca, N.Y.
The water was recalled due to bromate levels that exceed the standard imposed three years ago by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. However, based on information from the FDA and the New York State Department of Health, Kinney officials said the level of bromate discovered in the affected bottled water did not pose a health risk in humans.
"We want to assure our customers that the water does not pose a health risk," Kinney chief executive officer Craig Painter said.
Kinney operates 80 stores in New York and Vermont.
It's the second recall in the last month of bottled water produced by Mayer Bros., a 154-year-old bottled water and cider company based in suburban Buffalo. Garrett Mayer, vice president of the family-owned company, said the problems had been fixed.
"There were a few of our customers affected, but only a small percentage of the water we produce was affected," Mayer said Thursday. "To be safe, we brought back some product. It's just a precautionary measure. It's unfortunate that this has happened, but it's been rectified."
The Wegmans supermarket chain earlier this month pulled all sizes of its "Food You Feel Good About" brand water, also supplied by Mayer Bros. That recall covered water with "use-by" dates of Aug. 8, 2008 or earlier. The Wegmans-brand water also was found to contain elevated levels of bromate, which is formed during the disinfection process before bottling.
Wegmans said that though the Environmental Protection Agency has estimated a "cancer potency value" for bromate, there are no studies indicating that bromate in drinking water has caused adverse health effects in humans.
Syracuse-based Penn Traffic, which runs a number of supermarket chains, announced last week that it had pulled "Food Club" brand bottled water from its shelves and issued a recall for all sizes of that brand produced between June 27 and Aug. 4.
Penn Traffic wouldn't identify the supplier of its bottled water. The company said it has returned to the shelves bottles that were found to be unaffected, and stores have begun ordering new product to replenish their supplies.

Supplement products recalled for containing drug ingredients

Highlight: BotanicLab Inc voluntarily recalls 2 herbal dietary supplement products
Body




Wallace, Phil
A California company has voluntarily recalled two herbal dietary supplement products after the state Department of Health Services found they contain prescription drugs.
One product, PC SPES, was found to contain warfarin, a blood thinner marketed under the brand name Coumadin. The second product, SPES, contains alprazolam, a tranquilizer marketed under the brand name Xanax, according to the state testing.
"Consumers should stop using these products and immediately seek medical advice, especially if they currently are using any other prescribed medication," State Health Director Diana Bonta said Feb. 8. "Consumers should consult with their health care providers whenever they take an herbal product or a dietary supplement."
FDA followed California's lead, warning consumers that the undeclared drugs "could cause serious health effects if not taken under medical supervision."
BotanicLab Inc. marketed PC SPES with the claim "for prostate health," and SPES with a claim that it would help strengthen the immune system.
The company says PC SPES "contains herbs that have been documented in many plant pharmacopias for their unique activities. Saw palmetto has great popularity in Europe for its beneficial effects on the prostate and is rapidly gaining popularity in the U.S."
BotanicLab says SPES' " immune enhancing functions are documented in a clinical study. This formula is considered a 'Chi tonic' in Chinese tradition or 'adaptogen' by western herbalists, and means a product which increases resistance to physical, chemical or biological stress. SPES helps support the body after long term weakness. Only herbal extracts which pass our rigid standards are used. SPES does not contain any artificial ingredients."
According to the California agency, warfarin can cause serious bleeding that can be affected by many other prescription products. Alprazolam "exacerbates the effects of alcohol and other central nervous system depressants," the agency said. "It also may be habit forming."
Testing questioned
Although BotanicLab complied with the state's recall request, the company and a major trade association questioned whether the test results were valid.
While noting that "our first responsibility is to the safety and well-being of our customers," the company said it also conducted independent testing of its PC SPES product. Based on the advice of experts, the firm said that it "believes further analyses and testing[are]needed" to confirm that the product contains warfarin.
"Our independent lab experts believe the material in question may not be warfarin, but may instead be a phytocoumarin (a compound naturally synthesized in various green plants) that may 'mimic' warfarin in laboratory testing," BotanicLab said. "Naturally occurring organic compounds can occasionally mimic other substances unless additional testing measures are used."
The third-party testing "will indeed be more sensitive and thus hopefully provide more definitive information and results," BotanicLab added.
The company also said it has "undertaken a process to establish more rigorous controls throughout the entire production process, starting with raw materials we purchase from a number of suppliers in China."
Also expressing skepticism about the state's laboratory findings, the American Herbal Products Association referred to the two products as "allegedly adulterated."
"Final judgment needs to be withheld until further examination of the products takes place," AHPA President Michael McGuffin said Feb. 12. "If the allegations that led to the recall of PC SPES and SPES prove to be true, however, responsible marketers of herbal products will applaud aggressive enforcement of the law."Copyright 2002 Food Chemical News PublishingCopyright 2002 Food Chemical News Publishing537

Merck recalls blockbuster arthritis drug, stock plunges

Pharmaceutical giant Merck & Co. is halting worldwide sales of its blockbuster arthritis drug Vioxx, once viewed as possibly being able to prevent some cancers, because new data from a clinical trial found an increased risk of heart attack and stroke. Its stock price plunged more than 26 percent as the company said the recall will hurt its earnings.
Merck said Thursday that data from the trial showed the increased risk of heart attack and other cardiovascular complications began 18 months after patients started taking Vioxx. About 2 million people worldwide are currently taking Vioxx, according to Merck, and a total of 84 million have taken it since it came on the market with great fanfare in 1999.
The data comes from a three-year study aimed at showing that Vioxx at a 25 milligram dose prevents recurrence of polyps in the colon and rectum. Such polyps can turn cancerous. The trial was stopped after Merck discovered study participants had double the risk of a heart attack, compared to other participants taking dummy pills.
Medical experts advised patients to stop taking Vioxx and consult their doctor about alternatives, but said patients should not panic because the risk of a heart attack was still relatively low.
"It's a disaster for Merck, coming at the worst time," said independent health care analyst Hemant Shah of HKS & Co. in Warren, New Jersey.
Vioxx is one of Merck's most important drugs, with $2.5 billion ([euro]2.01 billion) in sales in 2003 - about 11 percent of the company's $22.49 billion ([euro]18.12 billion) in revenue that year. But sales dipped 18 percent in the second quarter of this year to $653 million ([euro]526 million), partly due to increasing concerns about the drug's safety.
"We're taking this action because we believe it best serves the interest of patients," Ray V. Gilmartin, Merck's chairman, president and chief executive, said in a statement.
"Although we believe it would have been possible to continue to market Vioxx with labeling that would incorporate these new data, given the availability of alternative therapies and the questions raised by the data, we concluded that a voluntary withdrawal is the responsible course to take," he said.
Merck, the world's third-biggest drug maker, announced the news before the stock market opened. In morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Merck shares plunged $11.98, or more than 26 percent, to $33.09.
Shah said the withdrawal of Vioxx comes "at a time when they really need to get ready for expiration" of its patent for Zocor, a drug for high cholesterol that is Merck's top-selling drug. Zocor loses patent protection early in 2006 and sales are expected to plunge when generic competition begins. In an effort to replace those revenues, Merck recently launched a drug with partner Schering-Plough Corp., Vytorin, that combines Zocor and Schering-Plough's Zetia to attack cholesterol levels in two complementary ways.
"This makes it almost inevitable for the company to find a merger partner for them to continue to grow," Shah said.
Merck's announcement stands to benefit rival Pfizer Inc., the world's biggest drug maker. The two companies have been battling for market share, with Pfizer's Celebrex arthritis drug dominating the market with about $5 billion ([euro]4.03 billion) in U.S. sales alone last year. Pfizer shares were up 17 cents to $30.35 in early trading on the NYSE.
"I think Celebrex sales are going to significantly increase," Shah said.
Vioxx and a successor drug called Arcoxia, approved in some other countries and awaiting Food and Drug Administration approval here, are part of a class of anti-inflammatory drugs heavily touted by the pharmaceutical industry as being more effective and having less side effects, particularly on the gastrointestinal system, than older drugs.
Pfizer's Celebrex and its successor drug, Bextra, which already is on the market in the United States, also are in that class, called cox-2 inhibitors.
"This has never been the massive innovation which was promoted to be," Shah said of the drug class. "In terms of pain relief, these drugs are no better than ibuprofen and they cost 10, 15 times more."
He said it is possible the news, along with some prior reports about heart risk and gastrointestinal bleeding linked to the drugs, could push some patients to go back to older, cheaper drugs.
Shah also said physicians prefer ibuprofen more than Celebrex and Vioxx combined.
The company said the Vioxx recall will slash about 50 cents to 60 cents a share from its earnings for the rest of this year. That includes foregone sales, writeoffs of inventory held by Merck, customer returns of product previously sold and other costs of the pullback. Merck expects foregone fourth quarter sales of Vioxx of $700 million ([euro]564 million) to $750 million ([euro]604 million) alone.
Merck, which is based in Whitehouse Station, New Jersey, had previously been expecting 2004 earnings per share of $3.11 to $3.17.
Merck is scheduled to release financial results for the third quarter, which ends today, on Oct. 21.

Over-the-counter diet supplement recalled; contains obesity drug

One lot of an over-the-counter dietary supplement sold in the United States and distributed in Canada is being recalled because it contains a prescription drug used in the treatment of obesity.
Health Canada issued an advisory to notify the public of the U.S. recall of one lot of Metaboslim Apple Cider Vinegar because it has been found to contain sibutramine, an appetite suppressant.
Health Canada said Metaboslim's manufacturer, Confidence Inc., has confirmed that some of the affected bottles have been distributed in Canada, even though the products are not authorized for sale in this country. The department is working with the importer to determine where the product was sold and to ensure that it is immediately removed from the market.
The product being recalled is Lot Number 3001006.EXP.102009. The affected Metaboslim product is sold in a plastic bottle with white and red labelling and contains 60 gelatin capsules.
People taking sibutramine should be monitored by a physician as the drug can cause serious side-effects, including cardiovascular reactions such as increased blood pressure, chest pain, and stroke. The drug may also interact with a number of other medications.
Sibutramine should not be taken by people who have had a heart attack, coronary artery disease, heart-related chest pain, irregular heart beats, congestive heart failure, a stroke or symptoms of a stroke. People with unstable or poorly controlled high blood pressure, or who are depressed or suffering from have a psychiatric illness, also should not take the drug.
As well, women who are pregnant, breastfeeding or planning to become pregnant shouldn't take sibutramine, the advisory noted.
People who have the recalled product are asked to immediately discontinue its use and consult their health-care professional if they have concerns. Consumers should return the product to the point of purchase.

Merck & Co. is pulling its blockbuster Vioxx from the market after new data found the arthritis drug doubled the risk of heart attacks and strokes. Merck's stock plunged almost 27 percent as the pharmaceutical giant said the recall will hurt its earnings.
Merck said Thursday the clinical trial data showed an increased risk of heart attack and other cardiovascular complications 18 months after patients started taking Vioxx, which also is prescribed for acute pain and disorders such as carpal tunnel syndrome.
The three-year study - aimed at showing that Vioxx could prevent the recurrence of polyps, which can turn cancerous, in the colon and rectum - was stopped after Merck discovered participants had double the risk of a heart attack compared to those taking a placebo. During the study, 10 patients died, five who had been taking Vioxx and five who took dummy pills.
By Thursday afternoon, at least one plaintiffs' attorney announced plans for a class-action lawsuit against Merck. Another claimed to represent 58 patients around the country allegedly harmed by Vioxx, including people who suffered a heart attack, stroke, internal bleeding or kidney failure.
Merck spokesman Tony Plohoros said the company anticipates additional personal injury lawsuits over Vioxx may be filed and will defend them vigorously.
"It's a disaster for Merck, coming at the worst time," said independent health care analyst Hemant Shah of HKS & Co. in Warren, N.J.
About 2 million people worldwide use Vioxx, Merck said, and 84 million prescriptions have been filled since it came on the market with great fanfare in 1999. It is one of Merck's most important drugs, with $1.8 billion in U.S. sales in 2003 and global sales of $2.5 billion - 11 percent of the company's $22.49 billion in revenue that year.
But Vioxx sales dipped 18 percent in the second quarter of this year to $653 million, partly due to increasing concerns about an elevated risk of heart complications.
Medical experts advised patients Thursday to stop taking Vioxx and consult their doctor about alternatives.
Merck said the recall will slash about 50 cents to 60 cents a share from its earnings for the rest of this year. That includes foregone sales, writeoffs of inventory held by Merck, customer returns of product previously sold and other costs of the pullback. Merck expects foregone fourth quarter sales of Vioxx of $700 million to $750 million alone.
Merck, based in Whitehouse Station, N.J., had previously been expecting 2004 earnings per share of $3.11 to $3.17.
"We're taking this action because we believe it best serves the interest of patients," Ray V. Gilmartin, Merck's chairman, president and chief executive, said in a statement.
Plohoros said that because of the expected drop in revenues, Merck will shift people who worked on Vioxx to other areas that would increase revenues, but not all would find new jobs. Affected workers will include scientists who have been doing ongoing studies on Vioxx, sales and marketing staff and manufacturing employees. He could not give an estimate on job cuts.
"We will not react to this event with short long-term actions such as decreased R&D spending, across-the-board job reductions or actions like salary freezes that would destroy employee morale," Plohoros said.
Shares in Merck, one of the world's biggest drug makers, plunged $12.07, nearly 27 percent, to close at $33.00 on the New York Stock Exchange. That wiped out $28 billion in market value. More than 140 million shares were traded, compared to a daily average below 10 million.
Shah said for Merck, the Vioxx withdrawal comes "at a time when they really need to get ready for expiration" of its patent for Zocor, the cholesterol treatment that is the company's top-selling drug.
Zocor loses patent protection early in 2006 and sales are expected to plunge against generic competition. In an effort to replace those revenues, Merck recently launched a drug with Schering-Plough Corp., Vytorin, that combines Zocor and Schering-Plough's Zetia to attack cholesterol levels in two complementary ways.
The Vioxx recall stands to benefit Pfizer Inc., the world's biggest drugmaker. Merck and Pfizer have been battling for market share, with Pfizer's Celebrex arthritis drug dominating the market with about $2.6 billion in U.S. sales alone last year. Pfizer shares were up 35 cents to $30.53 in afternoon trading on the NYSE.
Pfizer issued a statement Thursday citing the "outstanding long-term safety profile" of Celebrex and saying that in a recent FDA-sponsored study of 1.4 million patients, those who received Celebrex demonstrated no increased risk of cardiac trouble.
Vioxx was labeled with a warning about heart risks in 2002 after Merck's own study in 2000 uncovered the increased risk of heart attack and other complications. The Food and Drug Administration has been monitoring problems reported to it since then.
"This is not a total surprise," said Dr. Steven Galson, acting director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.
Dr. Steven Abramson, director of rheumatology at New York University Hospital for Joint Diseases, said "there are very few patients for whom there won't be a good alternative drug."
Besides generic anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen, naproxen and aspirin, those include Celebrex, which Abramson said has not been linked to heart complications.
Celebrex and its successor drug, Bextra, as well as Vioxx and a successor drug called Arcoxia that is awaiting FDA approval, are part of a class of anti-inflammatory drugs touted by the pharmaceutical industry as being more effective and having less side effects, particularly on the gastrointestinal system, than older drugs.
Vioxx's removal will be a blow to hopes that it and other drugs in the class known as COX-2 inhibitors could be used to prevent cancer in people at high risk of developing it. A landmark study in 2002 showed that small, daily doses of aspirin could prevent colon cancer, and studies hinted that COX-2 inhibitors might do the same - possibly without aspirin's side effects.
All COX-2 inhibitors can raise blood pressure, but Vioxx appears to be the only one that's been linked to higher risk of heart attacks and strokes, Galson said.
Merck is scheduled to release financial results for the third quarter, which ends today, on Oct. 21.

Merck and Pfizer have been battling for market share, with Pfizer's Celebrex arthritis drug dominating the market with about $2.6 billion in U.S. sales alone last year. Pfizer shares were up 35 cents to $30.53 in afternoon trading on the NYSE.
Pfizer issued a statement Thursday citing the "outstanding long-term safety profile" of Celebrex and saying that in a recent FDA-sponsored study of 1.4 million patients, those who received Celebrex demonstrated no increased risk of cardiac trouble.
Vioxx was labeled with a warning about heart risks in 2002 after Merck's own study in 2000 uncovered the increased risk of heart attack and other complications. The Food and Drug Administration has been monitoring problems reported to it since then.
"This is not a total surprise," said Dr. Steven Galson, acting director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.
Dr. Steven Abramson, director of rheumatology at New York University Hospital for Joint Diseases, said "there are very few patients for whom there won't be a good alternative drug."
Besides generic anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen, naproxen and aspirin, those include Celebrex, which Abramson said has not been linked to heart complications.
Celebrex and its successor drug, Bextra, as well as Vioxx and a successor drug called Arcoxia that is awaiting FDA approval, are part of a class of anti-inflammatory drugs touted by the pharmaceutical industry as being more effective and having less side effects, particularly on the gastrointestinal system, than older drugs.
Vioxx's removal will be a blow to hopes that it and other drugs in the class known as COX-2 inhibitors could be used to prevent cancer in people at high risk of developing it. A landmark study in 2002 showed that small, daily doses of aspirin could prevent colon cancer, and studies hinted that COX-2 inhibitors might do the same - possibly without aspirin's side effects.
All COX-2 inhibitors can raise blood pressure, but Vioxx appears to be the only one that's been linked to higher risk of heart attacks and strokes, Galson said.
Merck is scheduled to release financial results for the third quarter, which ends today, on Oct. 21.

OTTAWA (CP) _ Health Canada is advising consumers not to use Salt Spring Herbals Sleep Well Dietary Supplement after a sample was found to contain an undeclared sedative drug.
The drug, estazolam, can become habit-forming within a few months, Health Canada said in an advisory issued Wednesday.
Consumers already taking the capsules should consult with a health-care professional before stopping the supplement, since withdrawal symptoms may occur.
A recall of the supplement _ advertised as a natural health product to relieve insomnia and restless leg syndrome _ was initiated by its Canadian distributor, Salt Spring Herbals of British Columbia.
The most common side-effects associated estazolam-containing products are dizziness and drowsiness. More serious adverse effects include loss of memory, hallucinations, confusion and depression.
Drugs in the same class (benzodiazepine) as estazolam can be prescribed only by a physician, said Health Canada. ''Estazolam should not be used by people with an allergy to other benzodiazepines (such as Valium, Restoril and Ativan) or those affected by the neuromuscular disorder myasthenia gravis or sleep apnea.''
Estazolam should be used with caution by pregnant women, the elderly and anyone with a history of substance abuse.
Consumers who have purchased Salt Spring Herbals Sleep Well Dietary Supplement capsules should return the product to the place of purchase.
To date, no adverse reactions suspected to be associated with the use of this product have been reported in Canada.
The capsules are not authorized for sale in Canada, although they have been found on the Canadian market. The distributor is recalling the product based on preliminary findings with one package analyzed by Health Canada, and the department is conducting additional tests to determine the source of the undeclared drug.
The advisory does not apply to Nova Sleep Well, a melatonin-containing natural health product, which Health Canada has authorized NHP Research and Consulting Co. of Richmond, B.C., to sell.

AIDS Drug Recall Hits Poorest Patients

AUDIE CORNISH, host:
From NPR News, this is NEWS & NOTES. I'm Audie Cornish, in for Farai Chideya.
What would you do if you had full-blown AIDS and your life depended on a drug that had been yanked from the market? That's what happened to patients using a drug called Viracept. If you live in Europe where Viracept is just one of many AIDS treatments available, you just switch to something else. But in the developing world, thousands of AIDS patients use Viracept because it's one of the few drugs they can afford. And, unfortunately, that hypothetical recall, well, it's real.
For more, I spoke with Elisabeth Rosenthal, who's been covering the story for the International Herald Tribune.
Dr. ELISABETH ROSENTHAL (Correspondent, International Herald Tribune): Viracept is protease inhibitor. It used to be widely used, maybe five years ago, throughout the developed world in Europe and in the U.S. But it's been supplanted in Europe and the U.S. mostly as well as places like Canada, Japan, Australia by newer drugs that are better, easier to take, fewer side effects. So at this point, the largest portion of its use is in the developing world.
CORNISH: Now, the news of the recall of Viracept has trickled out over the last few months almost. Can you talk about what finally triggered a recall, and what Roche Pharmaceutical, the company that makes it, has said about it?
Dr. ROSENTHAL: Well, the company announced the recall, which was highly unusual because it was a global recall and that they took back the medicine from everywhere they sold it in early June. It had been precipitated, they say, because some patients who were on Viracept noticed when they opened the bottle that it had a funny smell, and a few of them said that they were feeling nauseated, I believe, as well.
And so it prompted the company to look into whether the medicine had been contaminated, which - actually, they don't like that word - they say whether the medicine contained an impurity - which they found it did - and that precipitated a recall on June 6th.
It still remains to be seen, you know, what kind of damage does this ethyl mesylate do, since it's a mutagen, meaning it does kinetic damage. It's particularly dangerous for kids and pregnant women.
CORNISH: And so, extensively, this is a drug that's available in these parts of the world that's more affordable than a lot of the drugs that are available in wealthier nations like the U.S. Can you talk about what the alternatives are then if you live in one of these countries where you've suddenly been told you're out of treatment. This treatment is contaminated in some way.
Dr. ROSENTHAL: Viracept, it should be said, is not a first-line drug anywhere. It's a second-line drug, meaning it is given to patients who can't tolerate the first-line drugs or who have HIV virus that's resistant to those drugs. So it isn't first-line but it is extremely widely used in the developing world still.
CORNISH: And so what is the global health community doing to try and get more information from Roche about what's going on?
Dr. ROSENTHAL: Well, Roche has had numerous meetings in some of the countries that have been affected, but I think the problem is that Roche doesn't have a representative in every nation. And in a number of poorer nations, there's been questions about, was there a suitable drug to replace Viracept, and also who's going to pay for the cost of this massive recall? Who's going to pay to notify patients in distant corners of poorer countries? Who's going to pay to get a replacement drug sometimes in countries where there's nothing licensed or affordable that can replace Viracept?
CORNISH: How can this situation or how could this situation jeopardize the trust that patients and doctors have between each other, especially in these areas of the world where it can be difficult convincing local populations to even get tested for HIV/AIDS?
Dr. ROSENTHAL: Well, I think trust has been a big - the issue has been different in every country. In some countries, there was very little impact because they weren't using Viracept anymore. In other countries, even where they didn't use Viracept very much anymore, there was a breakdown of trust because they said, look, all of a sudden we're told that this HIV protease inhibitor is toxic or potentially toxic, and we don't feel like we're getting very much information.
In other countries, there were much harder treatment issues where the advice was you better stop this medicine, and then the question was, okay, so what do we replace it with? And often there wasn't good - a very good answer, and that's a real problem for a person with HIV.
CORNISH: So moving forward, what's being done for these patients?
Dr. ROSENTHAL: Well, at the moment, the International Health Community, activists, World Health Organization, and the European Medicines Agency are still trying to define exactly where this medicine went, how many people took it, how many people took doses that were highly contaminated because they know that some of the batches had quite high levels of this impurity, and others had much lower levels, and trying to define what the long-term - short-term or long-term effects of exposure are.
The European Medicines Agency in agreement with Roche suspended the marketing license for Viracept, and also signed an agreement with the company stipulating that the company had to do more studies to better define how this impurity affected animals and by extrapolation, humans. And also required it to set up a registry of patients who had been taking the drug.
That agreement is with the European Medicines Agency so it's been much less clear how that would affect patients in places like South America and in Africa, who were taking the drug and need to be followed as well. It's not clear who will pay the cost of that, how long they'll be followed for, and what kind of help they'll get if it turns out that there is some kind of health problem caused by this impurity.
CORNISH: Well, Elisabeth, thank you for joining us. We'll be continuing to watch this issue.
Dr. ROSENTHAL: Thank you.
CORNISH: Elisabeth Rosenthal covers health, science and environmental issues for the International Herald Tribune. She also has an M.D. from Harvard Medical School.

China recalls tainted leukemia drugs, announces discovery of tainted US, Canadian meat

Chinese authorities have ordered the recall of tainted leukemia drugs blamed for causing leg pains and other problems, state media reported Sunday, the latest crisis to strike the country's embattled food and drug industries.
Most of the drugs involved methotrexate and cytarabin hydrochloride have been recovered and authorities have traced the remainder, the Xinhua News Agency said.
Authorities banned the sale and distribution of the drugs, produced by the Shanghai Hualian Pharmaceutical Co. in early July after some patients complained of adverse reactions.
The announcement came as Chinese food, drugs and other products ranging from toothpaste to seafood are under intense scrutiny because they have been found to contain potentially deadly substances.
China has been eager to cast itself as a victim too of unsafe imports and Xinhua on Saturday announced that inspectors recently found residue of the banned stimulant ractopamine in frozen pig kidney imported from the United States and frozen pork spareribs from Canada. Ractopamine is forbidden for use as veterinary medicine in China.
Xinhua said the 18.37 tons of frozen pork kidney and 24 tons of frozen pork ribs had been returned to the exporters, said the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine.
Ractopamine, a hormone that promotes the growth of lean meat in pigs and cattle, is banned by China and most other countries as a health hazard, although its use in stock animals is permitted in the United States. China has also banned imports of U.S. meat contaminated with salmonella, additives, and prohibited veterinary drugs.
The State Food and Drug Administration and the Health Ministry banned the two leukemia drugs after several children who were taking them complained of leg pains and experienced difficulty walking. Xinhua said some patients also complained of urine retention.
It said the Health Ministry and the drug regulator found the problems were caused by the medicine being tainted with vincristine sulfate, an anticancer drug. Xinhua said factories manufacturing the drugs had been closed.
China has taken a series of steps to crackdown on tainted drugs and other unsafe products, in part from concern over the reputation of its exports.
In the harshest action so far, the country's former top drug regulator was executed in July for taking millions of yuan (dollars, euros) in bribes to approve substandard medicines, including an antibiotic that killed at least 10 people.

Low-Key Recall of AIDS Drug Hits World's Poor

A total recall of an important AIDS drug widely used in developing countries has disrupted treatment for tens of thousands of the world's poorest patients, with no clear word from the manufacturer on when shipments will resume. 
  The recall of the drug, Viracept, by Roche Pharmaceuticals of Switzerland, went largely unnoticed in the developed world when it was announced in early June, after the company had discovered that some batches made at its Swiss plant contained a dangerous chemical. But the recall has caused growing concern among global health officials and in AIDS programs in many poor nations. They say the company did an inadequate job of informing patients and officials about the potential risks and helping them find affordable access to newer alternative drugs.  
  Roche said that it had been actively working with health officials across the globe and that the risk from the affected batches was  low. 
  The scope of Roche's recall is extraordinary, if not unprecedented, in the battle against the human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS, global health officials say. Dr. Lembit Rago, an official at the World Health Organization, said tens of thousands of people take Viracept worldwide, many of them poor people with H.I.V. in developing countries. The recall has left those patients with the painful choice of discontinuing a lifesaving medicine, or using a drug that might contain a dangerous contaminant.
  Officials at the W.H.O. in Geneva and the European Medicines Agency in London said  Roche had not provided information they consider essential for safeguarding public health: which countries the tainted medicine was shipped to, the concentration of the contaminant and what the company will do for its patients. The European agency, which regulates drugs for the European Union, has canceled Roche's license to market the drug.
  Dr. Rago called the recall ''sort of a disaster'' for patients in very poor countries. He said of Roche, ''They failed in communication.'' Roche has denied the accusation. The company, which had revenue of $35 billion last year, said it promptly notified health providers in the affected countries to discontinue use of the drug, which is dispensed in both pill and powder form. It also said it would cover the ''reasonable costs'' of the recall. It did not define ''reasonable costs.''
  So far, in some countries like Panama, patients or treatment programs have had to make up the difference in cost between Viracept and far more expensive alternatives. For some patients in other countries, like Venezuela, alternatives to Viracept are unavailable.
  Roche said the recall affected  ''Europe and some other world regions'' but has not been more specific. The recall does not affect the United States, Canada or Japan, where a version of Viracept is made by Pfizer.  Roche has been in discussions with Pfizer about supplying Pfizer's version to some affected countries, but regulatory and licensing issues could take ''some time,'' said Martina Rupp, a Roche spokeswoman.
  Roche sells Viracept for use in low-income countries at the discounted median price of about 28 cents a dose, according to the W.H.O.'s 2006 global price reporting system for AIDS medicine. The drug, also known as nelfinavir, is a member of the class of AIDS drugs known as protease inhibitors. It is considered an important defense against  H.I.V.,  but it has fallen out of favor in Europe in recent years compared with  newer medicines that are more convenient and cause fewer side effects. 
  In some places, newer substitutes are not available to patients, either because they are not licensed or are much more expensive, said people with H.I.V. and international health experts. In Panama, for example, a substitute drug, Kaletra, costs three times as much as Viracept.
  ''Roche has provided information, but there has been much less support in terms of who is going to pay the additional cost,'' said Dr. Cesar Nunez, the United Nations AIDS program's coordinator for Latin America, who is based in Panama.
  A more limited recall might have been possible had Roche been more forthcoming about the countries affected and the lots that were suspect, said Dr. Rago, the W.H.O. coordinator of quality assurance and safety for medicines. ''It's fine for Roche to say 'withdraw and replace,' but there may not be much else at hand to substitute'' in many places, he said. ''This is not just about Europe.''
  In response to  questions sent by e-mail, Ms. Rupp said Roche had shipped ''at least one packet of Viracept with high levels of the impurity to 35 countries.'' But she declined to say which countries because Roche regards such information as proprietary. High levels of the contaminant ''were observed in batches of Viracept that had been released to countries since March 2007,'' she said.
  The company made the recall worldwide ''in order to avoid confusion,'' she said. Roche estimates that about 45,000 patients were affected by the recall. Ms. Rupp said  the toxic substance, ethyl mesylate, should be called an ''impurity'' rather than a contaminant because it was created in the manufacturing process and because that type of chemical can be found in very low levels in other medicines, although it was not supposed to be present in Viracept.
  The company was performing studies on the issue, but the results would not be available for ''some months,'' she said. At high doses, ethyl mesylate has been shown to cause cancer in animals, and at lower levels it can cause genetic mutations, which means children and fetuses are particularly vulnerable.
  Asia Russell, the coordinator of international advocacy for Health Gap, a nongovernmental organization based in New York and Philadelphia that focuses on medical care in the developing world, said, ''It seems that Roche has abandoned these patients, since in many places there aren't ready alternatives.''
  In Venezuela, 3,000 people were on Viracept, paid for by the national health service, and the effect of the recall was ''severe,'' because many had no other options, said Edgar Carrasco, an advocate on issues relating to AIDS in Caracas.
  Alberto Nieve, another advocate, said  Roche had promised to make a donation of another medicine. ''Most people are still waiting,'' he said. ''They have not switched yet, especially outside Caracas.'' 
  In the month since the recall, officials at the European Medicines Agency and the W.H.O. said that they, too, would like more information from Roche about the dose of the contaminant and where exactly the medicine was sent.
  ''We have not gotten information, not even an order of magnitude,'' said Martin Harvey-Allchurch, a spokesman for the European agency. ''I understand sales figures are confidential, but I would have thought by now we would have this information.''
  Viracept was sold in 49 countries since 2004, according to the W.H.O., with more than 12 million units sold in 2006 and 2 million in 2007. Tido Von Schoen-Angerer, director of the essential medicines campaign at Doctors Without Borders, said about half of the 400 patients who received therapy supplied by the group in Africa were on Viracept. The alternate from Abbott is not yet available, he said.

"Roche has provided information, but there has been much less support in terms of who is going to pay the additional cost," said Dr. Cesar Nunez, the U.N. AIDS program's coordinator for Latin America, who is based in Panama.

The company was performing studies on the issue, but the results would not be available for "some months," she said. At high doses, ethyl mesylate has been shown to cause cancer in animals, and at lower levels it has caused genetic mutations, but data are extremely limited.
It is particularly harmful to children and pregnant women.
The global market for HIV drugs features different drugs at different prices in different places. HIV specialists now prefer Kaletra, made by Abbott Laboratories. It is in the same class of drugs as Viracept and has fewer side effects. But it has not been licensed in many middle-income and poor countries.

FDA Analysis of Drug Recalls Puts Spotlight on Bacteria
The Food & Drug Letter
December 4, 2009 Friday

 Copyright 2009 Washington Business Information, Inc. All Rights Reserved
Section: Vol.; No. 834
Length: 615 words

An FDA analysis of recalls shows drugmakers may be ignoring a persistent bacteria cited in a recent recall and warning letter.
Burkholderia cepacia is a danger, Lynn Torbeck, contractor for the FDA's recall root cause research (RRCR) project, said at the Parenteral Drug Association-FDA 2009 Joint Regulatory Conference in Washington, D.C. It is a common pathogen that can grow in distilled water, Torbeck said. "It forms biofilms ... and water and treatment in manufacturing plants are the primary problem," he added.
Another part of the problem is complacency. The bacteria is a high risk to immunocompromised people, but industry generally does not consider product contamination a major problem because there is a low risk to healthy people, Torbeck said.
Failing to control the bacteria levels may pose a risk of recalls or other regulatory actions. Recently, Johnson & Johnson subsidiary McNeil Consumer Healthcare recalled 57 lots of 21 liquid formulations of Tylenol for children and infants after detecting B. cepacia in an inactive ingredient.
The bacteria is not known to infect patients via ingestion. However, infection with the bacteria has been reported after use of contaminated products such as mouthwashes and nasal sprays. The bacteria also led to a January warning letter for Sage Products.
FDA Inspection Reveals Problem
An FDA inspection of the company's Cary, Ill., plant last summer revealed Sage did not include B. cepacia in its list of harmful microorganisms for which it tested bulk 2 percent chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) solution and CHG cloth products.
Sage had recalled products contaminated with B. cepacia in June 2006, and the microorganism should have been on the testing list, according to the letter. The company's failure to include the organism on the testing list also was observed during an inspection in September 2006.
The FDA's RRCR project is meant to assess available drug-product recall information using knowledge of pharmaceutical manufacturing and applied statistics to identify important recall patterns and trends. Identified recall categories include subpotency, dissolution and microbial contamination.
Another common issue leading to recalls is failure to test the full specification range for a product. Manufacturers may set specification ranges, but they may not test all of them The full specification range should be tested during design verification and process validation.
Drugmakers also make a mistake by "punishing" close calls when they are reported, leading employees to avoid calling attention to them. Instead, companies should treat close calls as opportunities for improvement.
Prioritizing the incidents may be beneficial. Management should devise the criteria for prioritization. It is important to review and recalibrate the criteria from time to time, so close calls can be measured against the criteria to determine the priority. Drugmakers should conduct a very thorough root cause analysis and identify solutions on the most serious events.
When entering close calls in a database, some experts suggest using a hybrid system -- reporting accidents and near-accidents to the same database. Depending on the intensity of the observation, such a system can quickly show what level of analysis will be required.
A hybrid system for accident and close call reports may be the best option because, with separate databases, people often are confused about where to report events. However, a single system must not require too much information for close calls, which can discourage reporting. A single reporting system with some check boxes indicating how much more information is required can be effective.

Bayer may sell its drug division; Pressure grows following recall of drug linked to patient deaths

FRANKFURT, Germany -- Germany's Bayer AG faces growing pressure to sell its beleaguered drug division, with analysts saying its recall of an anti-cholesterol drug linked to patient deaths shows the unit is too small to compete with larger rivals.
Bayer chief executive Manfred Schneider has hinted at a joint venture with a bigger rival.
But with added uncertainty over Bayer's liability in a raft of lawsuits over its Baycol treatment, and its stock down 25 percent, experts say a more drastic solution seems increasingly likely.
The chance of an outright sale is about 50-50, Themis Themistocleous, an analyst at UBS Warburg in London, said yesterday.
"A lot of people would argue that in pharmaceuticals you need size to be successful," he said, pointing to the deals that have produced giants like Britain's GlaxoSmithKline, the result of last year's merger of Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKlineBeecham.
GlaxoSmithKline declined comment yesterday on a report in Britain's Sunday Telegraph newspaper that it has approached Bayer's investment bankers to explore a bid.  The news helped Bayer stock recover 3.4 percent to 34.45 euros ($31.46) yesterday in Frankfurt.
Baycol, known as Lipobay outside the United States, is one of a popular family of drugs called statins that have been linked to rare reports of a side effect called rhabdomyolysis, a life-threatening condition in which muscle cells are destroyed and released into the bloodstream.
Bayer withdrew its No. 3 selling drug everywhere but Japan on Aug. 8 after it was linked to 52 deaths.
The loss of the drug will erode Bayer's earnings for years, but the firm has other promising products on the way, including a competitor to Pfizer's anti-impotence drug Viagra, analysts say.

Pharmacists stopped dispensing Vioxx and patients began asking their doctors about alternatives to the popular arthritis drug after Merck & Co. pulled it from the market because new data found it doubled the risk of heart attacks and strokes.
"We immediately called the nursing units and pulled the medications," said Beverly Grove, assistant administrator at the Rest Haven-York nursing home in York, Pa.
Merck's stock plunged almost 27 percent - wiping out $28 billion of market value - on Thursday as the pharmaceutical giant said the recall will hurt its earnings.
The withdrawal marks a serious blow to New Jersey-based Merck, one of the world's biggest drug makers. Vioxx accounted for $2.5 billion in worldwide sales in 2003, and 84 million prescriptions have been filled since the drug's introduction. An estimated 2 million people are now using it.
Dr. Kutaiba Tabbaa, director of pain management at University Medical Center in Tucson, Ariz., said switching to Pfizer Inc.'s Celebrex and its successor drug, Bextra, and other alternatives won't be a problem for most patients.
"There are no withdrawal symptoms and there are a lot of other medications available on the market," Tabbaa said. Alternatives also include generic anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen, naproxen and aspirin.
Vioxx, which is also prescribed for acute pain and disorders such as carpal tunnel syndrome, is seen as a potential cancer-prevention medicine as well. In fact, the recall was prompted by a three-year study aimed at showing that the drug could prevent the recurrence of potentially cancerous polyps in the colon and rectum.
Participants taking Vioxx for more than 18 months were found to be twice as likely as those given dummy pills to suffer a heart attack, stroke or other heart complications. During the study, 10 patients died, five who had been taking Vioxx and five who took dummy pills.
Pharmacists at Holy Spirit Hospital in Camp Hill, Pa., began identifying Vioxx patients immediately after learning of the recall Thursday morning, said pharmacy director Gregory George.
However, patients should take the initiative to contact their doctors. Many doctors don't have computer databases that let them quickly determine which of their patients are taking a specific drug, said Dr. Richard Pearis, a Phoenix orthopedic surgeon.
"We would hope that the patients would call us," said Pearis, who specializes in sports medicine and arthroscopy. "We'd tell them to stop taking it and what we'd like them to do."
At least one plaintiffs' attorney announced plans for a class-action lawsuit against Merck. Another claimed to represent 58 patients around the country allegedly harmed by Vioxx, including people who suffered a heart attack, stroke, internal bleeding or kidney failure.
Merck spokesman Tony Plohoros said the company anticipates additional personal injury lawsuits over Vioxx may be filed and will defend them vigorously.
The Vioxx recall stands to benefit Pfizer, the world's biggest drug maker. Merck and Pfizer have been battling for market share, with Pfizer's Celebrex arthritis drug dominating the market with about $2.6 billion in U.S. sales alone last year.
Vioxx was labeled with a warning about heart risks in 2002 after Merck's own study in 2000 uncovered the increased risk of heart attack and other complications. The Food and Drug Administration has been monitoring problems reported to it since then.
Tabbaa said he was among physicians who started steering patients away from Vioxx to alternatives because of earlier concerns about Vioxx.
"Two years ago I was using it like crazy," Tabbaa said.

China recalls tainted leukemia drugs, announces discovery of tainted U.S., Canadian meat

Chinese authorities ordered the recall of tainted leukemia drugs blamed for leg pains and other problems, state media reported Sunday, the latest crisis to strike the country's embattled food and drug industries.
Most of the drugs involved methotrexate and cytarabin hydrochloride have been recovered and authorities have traced the remainder, the Xinhua News Agency said. The report did not say if any of the drugs had been exported.
Authorities have banned the sale and distribution of the drugs, produced by the Shanghai Hualian Pharmaceutical Co., it said.
China, a major global supplier, has been facing growing international pressure to improve the quality of its exports after dangerous toxins from lead to an antifreeze ingredient were found in goods including toys and toothpaste.
China has been eager to cast itself as a victim, too, of unsafe imports. Xinhua on Saturday announced that inspectors recently found residue of the banned stimulant ractopamine in frozen pig kidneys imported from the United States and frozen pork spareribs from Canada. The names of the exporting companies were not identified. Ractopamine is forbidden for use as veterinary medicine in China.
Xinhua said the 18.37 tons of frozen pork kidneys and 24 tons of frozen pork had been returned to importers exporters, said the General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine (AQSIQ).
Ractopamine, a hormone that promotes the growth of lean meat in pigs and cattle, is banned by China and most other countries as a health hazard, although its use in stock animals is permitted in the U.S. and Canada. China has also recently banned imports of U.S. meat contaminated with salmonella, additives, and veterinary drugs.
Xinhua said the State Food and Drug Administration and Health Ministry banned the two leukemia drugs after several child leukemia patients who were taking them complained of leg pains and difficulty walking. Xinhua said some patients also complained of urine retention.
It said the Health Ministry and drug administration had traced the problems with the drugs to their being tainted with vincristine sulfate, an anticancer drug. Xinhua said factories manufacturing the drugs had been closed.
China has taken a series of steps to crackdown on tainted drugs and other unsafe products, in part due to concern over the reputation of its exports.
In the harshest action so far, the country's former top drug regulator was executed in July for taking millions of dollars in bribes to approve substandard medicines, including an antibiotic that killed at least 10 people.

Arthritis drug recalled over heart attack risk

TRENTON, N.J. (AP-CP) -- Vioxx, the blockbuster arthritis drug taken by tens of millions of people, was pulled from the market by its maker Thursday after a study found it doubled the risk of heart attacks and strokes.
Experts advised patients to immediately stop taking Vioxx, which was developed in Canada over a period of more than a decade, and talk to their doctors about alternatives.
"Given the availability of alternative therapies, and the questions raised by the data, we concluded that a voluntary withdrawal is the responsible course to take," said Ray V. Gilmartin, chairman, president and chief executive of Merck & Co.
Health Canada was among the regulatory bodies that approved the drug in 1999. Information from IMS Health, a private organization that tracks drug dispensing trends, shows that there were more than 3.3 million prescriptions for Vioxx in Canada last year -- making it the 10th most prescribed drug in 2003.
"What is important for Canadians to know is if they're on this medication, they should contact their family physician," Health Canada spokeswoman Jirina Vlk said in Ottawa.
"Every drug has a benefit versus a risk, so do the benefits outweigh the risks?" Vlk said. "Now we have new safety data that tops the balance."
Dr. Arthur Bookman, chairman of the Arthritis Society's Medical Advisory Committee in Toronto, said patients shouldn't be concerned about stopping Vioxx abruptly.
"There's no rebound effect of stopping the drug, except for, of course, the recurrence of the pain and inflammation."
The news of Vioxx's dangers came five years after Merck put the drug on the market with great fanfare. Vioxx has since become one of the world's most aggressively marketed drugs, advertised in magazines and in TV commercials, with celebrity endorsements from former athletes Dorothy Hamill and Bruce Jenner.
The withdrawal marks a serious blow to New Jersey-based Merck, the world's third-largest drug maker. Vioxx accounted for $2.5 billion US in worldwide sales in 2003, and has been taken by 84 million people worldwide since its introduction. An estimated two million people are now using it.
Last year, retail sales of the drug in Canada were $194.5 million.
Vioxx, which is also prescribed for acute pain and disorders such as carpal tunnel syndrome, is seen as a potential cancer-prevention medicine as well. In fact, the recall was prompted by a three-year study aimed at showing that the drug could prevent the recurrence of potentially cancerous polyps in the colon and rectum.

Lawsuit questions Bayer's handling of recalled drug;  Documents show the firm disregarded disturbing research on its side effects

A $100-million US lawsuit unfolding in a Texas courtroom has yielded e-mails and internal documents suggesting Bayer Corp. disregarded disturbing research on the cholesterol drug Baycol before pulling it off the market because of dozens of deaths.
The lawsuit -- brought by an 82-year-old retired engineer who says a muscle-destroying side-effect made his legs stop working -- is the first of thousands against Bayer to go to trial in the United States and Canada.
The side-effect, known as rhabdomyolysis, can clog the kidneys with disintegrating muscle tissue and cause them to fail. The Food and Drug Administration linked Baycol to at least 52 deaths worldwide, including 31 in the United States and at least one in Canada.
Windsor Star News Services
Pittsburgh-based Bayer has acknowledged the link and said it acted responsibly by withdrawing the drug, known clinically as cerivastatin, in 2001.
The lawsuit paints Bayer as a company overly eager to jump into the lucrative U.S. market for the cholesterol-fighting drugs known as statins. About eight million Americans use statins to lower their risk of heart attacks, making them the third most widely prescribed drug in the country.
Baycol won FDA approval in 1997 and became the fastest-growing drug in Bayer's history. By the time it was pulled in August 2001, it was Bayer's No. 3 seller, expected to earn some $720 million that year with six million patients worldwide.
At the trial, which opened Feb. 18, the plaintiff's lawyer Mikal Watts said Bayer knew of the dangers of the drug but proceeded with it anyway because of its profit potential.
Watts's legal team, using an FDA-maintained database, said Baycol was 79 times more likely to cause rhabdomyolysis than competing drugs.
Bayer lawyer Philip Beck said that after Bayer finishes presenting its case -- it began this week -- the jury would see that the company worked with the FDA to make sure Baycol was used safely.
450 cases
The pharmaceutical giant has paid $125 million to settle about 450 cases and investors are clearly worried. The U.S.-traded stock of German parent Bayer AG has fallen about one-fourth since the Texas trial began.
Internal documents and e-mails released by the plaintiff's lawyers show executives discussing potential dangers long before sales were halted.
Beck said the e-mails were taken out of context.
The plaintiff, Hollis Haltom, had his first bypass operation in 1970, but cholesterol drugs had helped keep him sprightly enough for outings with the yacht club, his church and his wife of more than 50 years.
Haltom said he developed problems weeks after his doctor gave him free samples of Baycol in May 2001. He wound up in a wheelchair, then a hospital.

U.S. asthma patients warned of Canadian drug recall

Americans with asthma who imported certain medications from Canada may have gotten a version being recalled in that country because of a potentially serious defect, U.S. health officials said Friday.
GlaxoSmithKline recalled certain batches of three asthma medicines - Ventolin Diskus, Flovent Diskus and Serevent Diskus - in Canada Friday, because a device malfunction may lead to too little, or none, of the drug getting into the patient's lungs.
Glaxo said the problem was caused by a manufacturing error, and pertained only to diskus versions - not the metered-dose inhaler, or spray form - of these medicines sold in Canada.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration emphasized that diskus products sold through legitimate pharmacies here are not subject to the recall. But patients who buy drugs from Canada, either through Internet sites or elsewhere, could have received some of the possibly ineffective batches, the FDA said.
Versions of these asthma medicines that Glaxo sells in the United States are actually made in a factory in Britain, while the company's Canadian-bound medicine is made in a French factory, said FDA pharmacy chief Tom McGinnis.
"We worry that some Americans may have the French-made product that they've bought in Canada. We suspect it's likely," he said.

Bayer issues partial drug recall as FDA investigates possible tampering

Federal regulators are investigating allegations that at least 13 vials of an immune deficiency treatment drug made by Bayer Corp. may have been tampered with by someone outside the company.
Bayer Corp. said Friday it uncovered evidence that someone diluted at least 13 vials of its liquid drug Gamimune N with saline. The company is recalling about 8,000 of the vials distributed nationwide and the Food and Drug Administration said it is investigating the matter.
Gamimune N is used by about 20,000 patients with weakened immune systems, including bone marrow transplant recipients.
Bayer said it knows of no patients harmed by the tampered drug. Bayer said it was unsure what effects the tainted drug would have on a patient.
Bayer said it believes the tampering occurred after the drug left its North Carolina plant and is limited to two lots handled by a single distributor, which the company refused to identify.
If in fact the diluted drug is limited to the two lots, the tampering of Bayer's therapy probably won't rise to the same level as Robert Courtney's crimes.
Courtney of Kansas City, Mo. pleaded guilty earlier this month to 20 counts of diluting chemotherapy drugs. He admitted to diluting medications 158 times for 34 patients. But the final number of victims, which has yet to be determined, could be in the hundreds.
Bayer makes two million vials of Gamimune N each year and a company executive said Bayer would not recall all the drug currently on the market, only the two lots the company believes contains the diluted drug.
"This is a product that is in high demand," said company vice president Michael Fournel. "Pulling it out of the marketplace will cause a real problem. It would leave a lot of people without the product. We have really isolated this incident to the two lots."
Fournel declined to offer more specific evidence.
"We have no reason to believe the other lots are affected," he said. "There is an ongoing investigation."
The FDA said it is comfortable with Bayer's limited recall decision.
"I think at this point the information indicates that the actions taken by Bayer are appropriate," said Steve Masiello, director of the office of compliance and biologics quality. Masiello also declined to offer specifics or to say whether any other federal agencies, such as the FBI, are helping with the investigation.
Bayer said customer complaints earlier this year that their vials of Gamimune N contained uncharacteristically cloudy liquid prompted it to recall one of the two questionable lots on Feb. 1. Fournel said the company has since received 500 vials from that first lot. Several of those vials showed obvious signs of tampering, Fournel said.
Bayer began recalling the second lot second lot on Thursday. Fournel said the company waited that long because it didn't conclude until Monday that someone had purposely tampered with the drugs.
The reason it took Bayer six weeks to start the second recall is "certainly part of our follow up investigation," said the FDA's Masiello.
Pittsburgh-based Bayer Corp. is a subsidiary of German conglomerate Bayer AG, which announced on Wednesday that its net profit dropped by 47 percent last year, partly due to its costly withdrawal of the anti-cholesterol treatment Baycol.
The company is in the midst of an overhaul launched last year to shore up earnings after voluntarily removing Baycol from the U.S. market last August after the FDA linked it to 31 deaths.

Consumers looking for alternatives to Vioxx have plenty of effective painkillers to choose from, ranging from similar prescription drugs like Celebrex to that old medicine chest standby, ASA.
Vioxx's maker, Merck & Co., pulled it from the market after a study showed that people taking it for 18 months or longer had twice the risk of heart attack, stroke or other cardiovascular problems.
About two million people currently take Vioxx, mostly for arthritis. The study was testing it for colon cancer prevention.
AP
Here are answers for consumers:
Q. If I've been on Vioxx, do I face a higher risk of heart problems in the future?
A. "The answer to that is almost certainly 'no'. The drug's effects disappear very quickly,'' so stopping it should reverse risk, said Dr. Alastair J.J. Wood, professor of medicine and pharmacology and associate dean of Vanderbilt University Medical Center.
Q. What about children? Some take it for juvenile arthritis.
A. No safety problems have been seen in children, according to the federal Food and Drug Administration, but Vioxx is being withdrawn from the market for everybody.
Q. Is it safe to stop taking Vioxx suddenly or should people go off the drug slowly?
A. People can and should stop taking the drug immediately. It is only used to treat arthritis pain symptoms, not the underlying disease.
Q. What made Vioxx so good for arthritis?
A. Many pain relievers called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDS, work against two enzymes, cox-1 and cox-2, that cause inflammation and pain. Cox-1 is found in the stomach, and drugs that attack it often cause upset stomachs and ulcers. Vioxx and other so-called cox-2 inhibitors attack just that enzyme, minimizing stomach side effects.
Q. Are other cox-2 inhibitors safe?
A. All drugs of this type can raise blood pressure, but only Vioxx has been linked to higher risk of heart attack, stroke and other cardiovascular problems, FDA officials say.
Q. What can people take in place of Vioxx?
A. Two other cox-2 inhibitors are sold in the United States _ Celebrex and Bextra. Other NSAIDs available by prescription include sulindac, sold as Clinoril, and ketoprofen, sold as Orudis and Oruvail. Non-prescription NSAIDS include ASA, ibuprofen (Advil), acetaminophen (Tylenol) and naproxen (Aleve).
Q. Besides arthritis, what else is Vioxx used to treat?
A. Other chronic pain conditions, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, and short-term needs like post-operative pain relief.
Q. Can I get a refund on unused Vioxx?
A. Yes. More instructions and information are available by checking the company's website. Doctors are being asked to send back samples, and pharmacists will be contacted by Merck representatives on returning unsold inventory.
Q. If Vioxx has been sold since 1999, why did these problems just come to light?
A. Some problems were noticed in a study Merck did in 1999 and 2000, and the FDA required a warning about the risks to be included in the drug's label after that. Isolated reports of problems were reported to the FDA since then, but that evidence was not as good or as strong as what just came from the Merck study.

Merck Mauled on Drug Recall

Updated from 7:43 a.m. EDT
Merck (MRK:NYSE) shares staged a minor recovery early Friday after a 27% decline Thursday when the nation's No. 2 drugmaker said it was taking its arthritis drug Vioxx off the market because of heart safety concerns.
As a result, the company also said it was withdrawing third-quarter financial guidance and cutting its full-year earnings estimate by 50 cents to 60 cents a share.
The company said its decision to pull Vioxx voluntarily, which is effective immediately, is based on new, three-year data from a clinical trial. The trial, which is being stopped, was designed to evaluate the efficacy of Vioxx in preventing recurrence of colorectal polyps
Merck shares were up 49 cents, or 1.4%, to $33.49 Friday. On Thursday, they fell $12.07, or 26.8%, to $33 even, erasing about $25 billion from the company's market capitalization. Shares were down another 9 cents after hours. The stock had traded as low as $32.46 during the day. Some 139 million shares changed hands, about 27 times the average daily volume. The vicious selloff, however, may not reflect the company's fundamentals, given the drug's contribution to overall revenue, Merck's strong finances and the fact that analysts didn't rush to downgrade the stock.
During the study, researchers found an "increased relative risk for confirmed cardiovascular events," such as heart attack and stroke, beginning after 18 months of treatment in the patients taking Vioxx compared with those taking placebo.
 Merck is pulling the product "because we believe it best serves the interests of patients," said Raymond V. Gilmartin, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Merck. "Although we believe it would have been possible to continue to market Vioxx with labeling that would incorporate these new data, given the availability of alternative therapies, and the questions raised by the data, we concluded that a voluntary withdrawal is the responsible course to take."
 The company added that the results for the first 18 months of the polyp study "did not show any increased risk of confirmed cardiovascular events on Vioxx, and in this respect are similar to the results of two placebo-controlled studies described in the current U.S. labeling for Vioxx."
 The Food and Drug Administration said Thursday that "the risk that an individual patient taking Vioxx will suffer a heart attack or stroke related to the drug is very small" and that its users should contact their physicians for guidance in discontinuing Vioxx and seeking other drugs.
Merck learned about the results on the evening of Sept. 23 from an external, independent safety monitoring board, a company spokesman said. Until then, the company wasn't aware of the results. After those results became known, the company held discussions with its own medical staffers and outside medical experts to plan the next step.
 The FDA said Merck contacted the agency on Sept. 27 to request a meeting on the clinical trial. Merck and agency officials met Tuesday, and that's when the FDA said it was informed that Merck was withdrawing the drug. "Merck did the right thing by promptly reporting these findings to the FDA and voluntarily withdrawing the product from the market," said Dr. Lester M. Crawford.
"Although the risk that an individual patient would have a heart attack or stroke related to taking the drug is very small, the study that was halted suggests that, overall, patients taking the drug chronically face twice the risk of a heart attack compared to patients receiving a placebo," Crawford said.
Gilmartin told the CNBC financial TV network that five people taking a placebo died and five people taking Vioxx died during the clinical trial.
While Merck officials were meeting with the FDA, Gilmartin was meeting with his board of directors Tuesday to discuss the clinical trial and to recommend withdrawing the drug. Gilmartin told CNBC that the directors were "fully supportive" and "fully on board" with his recommendation to withdraw the drug.
Asked at a Thursday news conference whether he planned to resign, Gilmartin said he would not
 Bad news has fallen hard on Gilmartin, who reaches mandatory retirement age of 65 in March 2006. The company cancelled research on four promising compounds last year, including late-stage tests on drugs for diabetes and depression; its Zocor anticholesterol drug, which accounted for 22% of corporate revenue last year, faces U.S. patent expiration in early 2006; and the company has been criticized on Wall Street for moving slowly to improve its pipeline through licensing deals.
Despite Merck's top-notch credit rating and strong reputation, its stock has been declining. It is reeling from the recent failure of several experimental drugs. And it is starting to feel the impact of patent expirations on important existing products. A recent study by the SG Cowen brokerage shows that among nine Big Pharma companies, Merck has 29% of 2003 revenue at risk due to product patents expiring between 2004 and 2008. The average generic risk among Merck's peers is 16% of 2003 revenue.
 After the market closed, Standard & Poor's cut its outlook for Merck to negative from stable. However, the credit rating firm kept its highest-level AAA corporate credit and senior unsecured debt ratings for Merck.
"The ratings … reflect its continued strong position in the pharmaceutical industry, despite the loss of Vioxx and the prospective loss of market exclusivity on the drug Zocor in the first half of 2006," said analyst Arthur Wong. "The company maintains a superior financial profile and a very conservative financial policy, and it continues to generate cash well in excess of ongoing needs."
Not everyone was so positive. The Vioxx withdrawal "was a disaster," said Sena Lund, of Cathay Financial, an investment research firm. "Merck has real problems." Lund doubts, however, that Gilmartin will be thrown overboard because he is too near mandatory retirement age and because it will take a long time to choose a successor. Experts in corporate management agree that dumping Gilmartin won't help the company.
A few weeks ago, Lund told The Street.com that he doubted Merck would make a big acquisition to improve its financial condition. On Thursday, he added that despite the plunge in the company's stock, he discounted the possibility that Merck would be a takeover target. "Why spend the money?" he said. (Lund has a neutral rating on the stock. He owns shares; his firm doesn't have an investment banking relationship.)
 It appears that trial lawyers will be spending money. An Oklahoma City firm said it had filed a suit Thursday based on the Vioxx test results. Merck's most recent 10-K report said the company is subject to a number of Vioxx-related suits alleging injuries from side effects including heart problems and kidney damage. The lawsuits have been filed in federal courts and several state courts, Merck says. The company says these lawsuits are "without merit" and will "vigorously" fight them.
 "We believe it's impossible to estimate the Vioxx litigation risk," said David R. Risinger, a Merrill Lynch analyst, in a research note to clients Thursday. But as a result of a likely spike in lawsuits, we think Merck is likely to expense more legal costs and take additional reserves over time."
Risinger, who has a neutral rating on the stock, said lawsuits "could overhang the Merck stock for an extended period," noting the experience of one of its industry rivals.
Risinger noted that Vioxx has been taken by 84 million patients whereas the diet drug fen-phen, made by Wyeth (WYE:NYSE) and withdrawn in 1996 because it was linked to heart valve damage, was used by only 6 million people.
He said Wyeth has taken $16 billion to $17 billion in charges and has paid out over $13 billion related to the lawsuits. Because litigation is continuing, Wyeth could incur more costs.
Risinger added that a "significant percentage" of Vioxx has been used short-term, "adding that "cardiovascular risks appeared to primarily result from long-term use." He added that it may be tougher to link Vioxx to a range of heart-related problems than it was to tie fen-phen to heart valve damage. (His firm is a market maker in Merck's stock and expects to seek or receive investment banking fees from Merck within the next three months. His report says "one or more analysts" responsible for the report owns shares in Merck.)
Needless to say, Merck received no mercy from the investment community. Morningstar was in the process of reviewing its 4-star rating and $53 fair value estimate on the stock, said Amy Arnott, a drug industry analyst for the Chicago-based research firm. (Five stars is the best rating). "We will revise it downward," said Arnott, who doesn't own shares and whose firm doesn't have a business relationship with Merck.
Although Merck had disputed some previous independent research on Vioxx, "the evidence was so clear that they didn't have a choice," she said.
"The Vioxx problem has been something that has been discussed for a long time," said Albert Rauch, an A.G. Edwards drug industry analyst, in a report to clients Thursday. "The difference with this trial is that it took the safety evaluation past 18 months of therapy." If the study had ended after 18 months, the results wouldn't have been negative, he explained.
"Other studies, including those used in the approval process by the FDA did not demonstrate an increased risk, although anecdotal evidence has started to show up," said Rauch, who kept his hold recommendation. (He doesn't own shares; his firm doesn't have an investment banking relationship.)
 The bad news for Merck was good news for rival Pfizer (PFE :NYSE), which also markets a leading arthritis drug. Pfizer shares rose 22 cents, or 0.7%, to $30.40, while the Amex Pharmaceutical Index was down 2.9%.
Prior to the Vioxx withdrawal, analysts had been expecting earnings of $3.11 to $3.17 per share, and Gilmartin said he had been comfortable with those predictions prior to Thursday's announcement.
 The reduced estimate reflects forgone sales, write-offs of inventory, customer returns of product previously sold, and costs to undertake the pullback of the product. The company also said it was withdrawing its financial guidance for the third quarter. Merck estimated that forgone fourth-quarter sales of Vioxx will amount to $700 million to $750 million. In addition, Merck expects that about one month's worth of inventory worldwide is held by customers and will be returned.
"At this point it is uncertain which of these costs will be recorded in the third quarter and which will be recorded in the fourth quarter," Gilmartin said. "Therefore, at this point, Merck is retracting the third-quarter guidance it had previously provided."
Gilmartin said that despite the Vioxx action, the company is "very strong financially." He said the economic impact won't force Merck to close any plants, fire sales staff or adjust its stock dividend.
 
More Bad News
The latest clinical trial follows a recent study sponsored by the Food and Drug Administration that said that Vioxx put users at a greater risk of heart attacks than Pfizer's Celebrex. The study said people using Merck's arthritis drug had a 50% greater chance of heart attacks and sudden cardiac death than those using Pfizer's Celebrex. Both drugs are called COX-2 inhibitors.
 In response to that news, Kaiser Permanente, which contributed resources to the study, said it would review the drug. Merck officials on Thursday reiterated their previous criticism that this study wasn't adequately designed. Peter Kim, president of Merck Research Laboratories, said Thursday that the FDA-sponsored study was an observational look at past data rather than a clinical trial, like the one that led to Merck's decision to withdraw Vioxx.
Vioxx and Celebrex have been important drugs for the companies. For the six months ended June 30, Pfizer sold $1.5 billion worth of Celebrex and $545 million worth of Bextra, another COX-2 inhibitor.
Pfizer, whose shares rose on the news, said Thursday that it was confident in the long-term safety of its drug.
 For the first half of the year, Merck reported worldwide Vioxx sales of $1.3 billion, plus another $92 million in foreign sales for Arcoxia, a next-generation COX-2 inhibitor. Vioxx was launched in the U.S. in 1999 and has been marketed in more than 80 countries. Worldwide sales of Vioxx in 2003 were $2.5 billion.
 The decision to withdraw Vioxx also raises questions about Arcoxia, but Merck executives said Thursday that tests of one drug cannot be extrapolated to another.
"The results of clinical studies with one molecule in a given class are not necessarily applicable to others in the class," the company said.
Merck said it will work with regulators in the 47 countries where Arcoxia is approved "to assess whether changes to the prescribing information...are warranted." The company said it continues to seek approval for Arcoxia in other countries, including the United States. "Merck will continue its extensive clinical program to collect additional longer-term data for Arcoxia as a treatment for arthritis and acute pain.

Drug Ads Losing Recall Effectiveness Among Consumers

If you think that marketing in the drug category is becoming less interesting and more monotonous, you're right. 
A ranking of the most-recalled prescription drug ads shows that prescription drug ads became less memorable for consumers between this year and last, as measured by Nielsen IAG, New York.
The drug ads consumers remembered best in 2007 were executions for Schering-Plough's allergy drug Nasonex, Takeda's sleeping pill Rozerem, Schering's anti-cholesterol brand Vytorin, Pfizer's anti-cholesterol brand Lipitor and its anti-smoking brand Chantix, and Sepracor's insomnia med Lunesta.
But midway through 2008, all of those brands have run into controversy or economic difficulties, and some of them pulled much or their entire consumer advertising.
What is left, according to IAG, is a bunch of drug ads that would not have made the grade last year: Six of the most-remembered ads this year would not have made it into the top 10 last year, based on IAG's recall index. 
Among the drug ads that have hit rocky patches:  
* Nasonex's animated bee ads have become the subject of an FDA inquiry into whether visuals distract viewers when ads deliver their warnings and safety messages.
* Rozerem, which has struggled to gain market share, cut the ad spend on its dreamlike Abraham Lincoln-meets-a-talking-beaver ads by 77%, according to Nielsen Monitor-Plus. (Nielsen IAG, Nielsen Monitor-Plus and Brandweek are divisions of The Nielsen Co.)
* Vytorin was the subject of media frenzy when Shering revealed a study that said it had no effect on narrowed arteries and may heighten cancer risk.
* Lipitor sales were challenged when Merck's rival brand, Zocor, went generic and became available for pennies on the dollar. Then Pfizer pulled its ads featuring artificial heart pioneer Robert Jarvik after it emerged he was not a practicing doctor.
* Sepracor went on a cost-cutting drive, slashing the ad budget for Lunesta by 39%. 
According to IAG's svp for healthcare, Fariba Zamaniyan, creative strength also is an issue. The ads that were dialed back had strong, established characters, such as Jarvik or the Lunesta moth, and had been running for a long time. The current crop of ads, including spots for Pfizer's Lyrica and Warner Chilcott's Loestrin 24Fe, are simply less established than their predecessors. "The overall average has come down. A high bar was set, but now it's just not as high," Zamaniyan said. 
Zamaniyan speculated that increased attention by the FDA and the media to drug ad controversies could lead to more creatively conservative advertising. Those types of spots often feature doctors addressing the viewer directly, or slice-of-life vignettes in which middle-aged folk recommend drugs to each other, and they tend to be less memorable.

$100 million lawsuit questions Bayer's handling of recalled cholesterol drug

A $100 million lawsuit unfolding in a Texas courtroom has yielded e-mails and internal documents that suggest Bayer Corp. disregarded disturbing research on the cholesterol drug Baycol before it was pulled off the market because of dozens of deaths.
The lawsuit - brought by an 82-year-old retired engineer who says a muscle-destroying side effect made his legs stop working - is the first of thousands against Bayer to go to trial in the United States.
The side effect, known as rhabdomyolysis, can clog the kidneys with disintegrating muscle tissue and cause them to fail. The Food and Drug Administration linked Baycol to at least 52 deaths worldwide, including 31 in the United States.
Pittsburgh-based Bayer has acknowledged the link and said it acted responsibly by withdrawing the drug, known clinically as cerivastatin, in 2001.
The lawsuit paints Bayer as a company overly eager to jump into the lucrative U.S. market for the cholesterol-fighting drugs known as statins. About 8 million Americans use statins to lower their risk of heart attacks, making them the third most widely prescribed drug in the nation.
Baycol won FDA approval in 1997 and became the fastest-growing drug in Bayer's history. By the time it was pulled in August 2001, it was Bayer's No. 3 seller, expected to earn some $720 million that year with 6 million patients worldwide, including 700,000 in the United States.
At the trial, which opened Feb. 18, plaintiff's attorney Mikal Watts said Bayer "knew its drug would kill people, that chose to go ahead and kill people anyway so they could go ahead and make a billion dollars."
Watts' legal team, using an FDA-maintained database, said Baycol was 79 times more likely to cause rhabdomyolysis than competing drugs.
Bayer attorney Philip Beck said that after Bayer finishes presenting its case - it began this week - the jury would see that the company worked with the FDA to make sure Baycol was used safely.
The pharmaceutical giant has paid $125 million to settle about 450 cases, and investors are clearly worried. The U.S.-traded stock of German parent Bayer AG has fallen about one-fourth since the Texas trial began.
Internal documents and e-mails released by the plaintiff's lawyers show executives discussing potential dangers long before sales were halted.
In June 2000, an e-mail to a vice president noted that "there have been some deaths related to Baycol," and that people at its marketing partner, SmithKline Beecham, knew it.
"So much for keeping this quiet," the e-mail said.
"How will marketing spin this?" another e-mail wondered.
Beck said the e-mails were taken out of context.
The plaintiff, Hollis Haltom, had his first bypass operation in 1970, but cholesterol drugs had helped keep him sprightly enough for outings with the yacht club, his church and his wife of more than 50 years.
Haltom said he developed problems weeks after his doctor gave him free samples of Baycol in May 2001. He wound up in a wheelchair, then a hospital. He has recovered much of his energy, but his legs still buckle when he tries to rise from the easy chair in his Padre Island home.
Haltom received samples in doses of 0.8 milligrams, a new, larger portion that Bayer had hoped would let Baycol match the effectiveness of rival drugs. An internal letter in June 1999 estimated that the higher dosage would add $25 million a month to Baycol sales.
But the minutes from a teleconference among Bayer executives in April 2001 - the month before Haltom got Baycol - show that the company had received "adverse event reports" about the drug. "No samples .8 should be released, and audit of samples and inventory should be done," the minutes said.
An internal e-mail two months later indicated that the company took a different course. It waited two months before sending doctors a letter warning them not to start patients at the higher dosage, and it never printed labels with updated safety information.
"A decision was apparently made to use up the currently existing inventory," wrote Mary Taylor of North American regulatory affairs.
Haltom is seeking $100 million from Bayer and its partner, now known as GlaxoSmithKline.
Bayer said it faces about 7,800 lawsuits from former Baycol users, mostly in the United States. Beck, the Bayer attorney, said the company is taking responsibility for the drug and would rather compensate victims than fight them in court. But he said Haltom's lawyer had backed Bayer up against the wall by demanding a settlement covering 1,600 plaintiffs.
"Most of those cases are meritless," Beck said. "We weren't going to be held hostage like that."
South Texas juries have a reputation of favoring plaintiffs with large awards in personal-injury cases. And Watts, 35, was part of the team that won a $7.5 million settlement in a suit against Ford and Bridgestone/Firestone in 2001. He also won a $43 million verdict against Pfizer over its diabetes drug, Rezulin, though that case was settled in January for a lesser, undisclosed sum.
As a jury was being selected in the Baycol case, Bayer sent a letter to about 2,000 businesses and homes in Corpus Christi, telling people they might soon see negative news about the company and asking them to "keep an open mind."
The letter prompted cries of jury tampering. The district attorney's office is investigating. Beck apologized for the letter but said no jurors never saw it.

Alternatives sought, stock plunges as Merck recalls anti-pain drug
The Associated Press State & Local Wire

Pharmacists stopped dispensing Vioxx and patients began asking their doctors about alternatives to the popular anti-pain drug after Merck & Co. pulled it from the market because new data found it doubled the risk of heart attacks and strokes.
"We immediately called the nursing units and pulled the medications," said Beverly Grove, assistant administrator at the Rest Haven-York nursing home in York, Pa.
Merck's stock plunged almost 27 percent - wiping out $28 billion of market value - on Thursday as the Whitehouse Station, N.J.-based pharmaceutical giant said the recall will hurt its earnings.
Vioxx is one of Merck's most important drugs, with $1.8 billion in U.S. sales in 2003 and global sales of $2.5 billion - 11 percent of the company's $22.49 billion in revenue that year.
Merck said approximately 2 million people worldwide use Vioxx, which is prescribed for arthritis, acute pain and disorders such as carpal tunnel syndrome. The company says it has been prescribed 84 million times.
"I'm going to check with my supplier and my doctor," Mike Adams of Sun City, Ariz., said after learning of the recall. Adams said he takes the drug "only when I have pain" from prostate surgery.
Dr. Kutaiba Tabbaa, director of pain management at University Medical Center in Tucson, Ariz., said switching to Pfizer Inc.'s Celebrex and its successor drug, Bextra, and other alternatives won't be a problem for most patients.
"There are no withdrawal symptoms and there are a lot of other medications available on the market," Tabbaa said.
Dr. Steven Abramson, director of rheumatology at New York University Hospital for Joint Diseases, said "there are very few patients for whom there won't be a good alternative drug."
Besides Celebrex, which Abramson said hasn't been linked to heart complications, alternatives include generic anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen, naproxen and aspirin.
Pharmacists at Holy Spirit Hospital in Camp Hill, Pa., began identifying Vioxx patients immediately after learning of the recall Thursday morning, said pharmacy director Gregory George.
Holy Spirit's medical staff had previously authorized a substitute for Vioxx, George said.
However, patients should take the initiative to contact their doctors. Many doctors don't have computer databases that let them quickly determine which of their patients are taking a specific drug, said Dr. Richard Pearis, a Phoenix orthopedic surgeon.
"We would hope that the patients would call us," said Pearis, who specializes in sports medicine and arthroscopy. "We'd tell them to stop taking it and what we'd like them to do."
Pearis said he would switch his patients to another anti-inflammatory drug.
Merck said the clinical trial data showed an increased risk of heart attack and other cardiovascular complications 18 months after patients started taking Vioxx.
The three-year study - aimed at showing that Vioxx could prevent the recurrence of polyps, which can turn cancerous, in the colon and rectum - was stopped after Merck discovered participants had double the risk of a heart attack compared to those taking a placebo. During the study, 10 patients died, five who had been taking Vioxx and five who took dummy pills.
At least one plaintiffs' attorney announced plans for a class-action lawsuit against Merck. Another claimed to represent 58 patients around the country allegedly harmed by Vioxx, including people who suffered a heart attack, stroke, internal bleeding or kidney failure.
Merck spokesman Tony Plohoros said the company anticipates additional personal injury lawsuits over Vioxx may be filed and will defend them vigorously.
Shares in Merck, one of the world's biggest drug makers, plunged nearly 27 percent Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange. More than 140 million shares were traded, compared to a daily average below 10 million.
The Vioxx recall stands to benefit Pfizer, the world's biggest drug maker. Merck and Pfizer have been battling for market share, with Pfizer's Celebrex arthritis drug dominating the market with about $2.6 billion in U.S. sales alone last year.
Vioxx was labeled with a warning about heart risks in 2002 after Merck's own study in 2000 uncovered the increased risk of heart attack and other complications. The Food and Drug Administration has been monitoring problems reported to it since then.
Tabbaa said he was among physicians who started steering patients away from Vioxx to alternatives because of earlier concerns about Vioxx.
"Two years ago I was using it like crazy," Tabbaa said.
Vioxx's removal will be a blow to hopes that it and other drugs in the class known as COX-2 inhibitors could be used to prevent cancer in people at high risk of developing it. A landmark study in 2002 showed that small, daily doses of aspirin could prevent colon cancer, and studies hinted that COX-2 inhibitors might do the same.

A $100 million lawsuit unfolding in a Texas courtroom has yielded e-mails and internal documents that suggest Bayer Corp. disregarded disturbing research on the cholesterol drug Baycol before it was pulled off the market because of dozens of deaths.
The lawsuit - brought by an 82-year-old retired engineer who says a muscle-destroying side effect made his legs stop working - is the first of thousands against Bayer to go to trial in the United States.
The side effect, known as rhabdomyolysis, can clog the kidneys with disintegrating muscle tissue and cause them to fail. The Food and Drug Administration linked Baycol to at least 52 deaths worldwide, including 31 in the United States.
Pittsburgh-based Bayer has acknowledged the link and said it acted responsibly by withdrawing the drug, known clinically as cerivastatin, in 2001.
The lawsuit paints Bayer as a company overly eager to jump into the lucrative U.S. market for the cholesterol-fighting drugs known as statins. About 8 million Americans use statins to lower their risk of heart attacks, making them the third most widely prescribed drug in the nation.
Baycol won FDA approval in 1997 and became the fastest-growing drug in Bayer's history. By the time it was pulled in August 2001, it was Bayer's No. 3 seller, expected to earn some $720 million that year with 6 million patients worldwide, including 700,000 in the United States.
At the trial, which opened Feb. 18, plaintiff's attorney Mikal Watts said Bayer "knew its drug would kill people, that chose to go ahead and kill people anyway so they could go ahead and make a billion dollars."
Watts' legal team, using an FDA-maintained database, said Baycol was 79 times more likely to cause rhabdomyolysis than competing drugs.
Bayer attorney Philip Beck said that after Bayer finishes presenting its case - it began this week - the jury would see that the company worked with the FDA to make sure Baycol was used safely.
The pharmaceutical giant has paid $125 million to settle about 450 cases, and investors are clearly worried. The U.S.-traded stock of German parent Bayer AG has fallen about one-fourth since the Texas trial began.
Internal documents and e-mails released by the plaintiff's lawyers show executives discussing potential dangers long before sales were halted.
In June 2000, an e-mail to a vice president noted that "there have been some deaths related to Baycol," and that people at its marketing partner, SmithKline Beecham, knew it.
"So much for keeping this quiet," the e-mail said.
"How will marketing spin this?" another e-mail wondered.
Beck said the e-mails were taken out of context.
The plaintiff, Hollis Haltom, had his first bypass operation in 1970, but cholesterol drugs had helped keep him sprightly enough for outings with the yacht club, his church and his wife of more than 50 years.
Haltom said he developed problems weeks after his doctor gave him free samples of Baycol in May 2001. He wound up in a wheelchair, then a hospital. He has recovered much of his energy, but his legs still buckle when he tries to rise from the easy chair in his Padre Island home.
Haltom received samples in doses of 0.8 milligrams, a new, larger portion that Bayer had hoped would let Baycol match the effectiveness of rival drugs. An internal letter in June 1999 estimated that the higher dosage would add $25 million a month to Baycol sales.
But the minutes from a teleconference among Bayer executives in April 2001 - the month before Haltom got Baycol - show that the company had received "adverse event reports" about the drug. "No samples .8 should be released, and audit of samples and inventory should be done," the minutes said.
An internal e-mail two months later indicated that the company took a different course. It waited two months before sending doctors a letter warning them not to start patients at the higher dosage, and it never printed labels with updated safety information.
"A decision was apparently made to use up the currently existing inventory," wrote Mary Taylor of North American regulatory affairs.
Haltom is seeking $100 million from Bayer and its partner, now known as GlaxoSmithKline.
Bayer said it faces about 7,800 lawsuits from former Baycol users, mostly in the United States. Beck, the Bayer attorney, said the company is taking responsibility for the drug and would rather compensate victims than fight them in court. But he said Haltom's lawyer had backed Bayer up against the wall by demanding a settlement covering 1,600 plaintiffs.
"Most of those cases are meritless," Beck said. "We weren't going to be held hostage like that."
South Texas juries have a reputation of favoring plaintiffs with large awards in personal-injury cases. And Watts, 35, was part of the team that won a $7.5 million settlement in a suit against Ford and Bridgestone/Firestone in 2001. He also won a $43 million verdict against Pfizer over its diabetes drug, Rezulin, though that case was settled in January for a lesser, undisclosed sum.
As a jury was being selected in the Baycol case, Bayer sent a letter to about 2,000 businesses and homes in Corpus Christi, telling people they might soon see negative news about the company and asking them to "keep an open mind."
The letter prompted cries of jury tampering. The district attorney's office is investigating. Beck apologized for the letter but said no jurors never saw it.

Pharmacia Corporation, based in Peapack, New Jersey, is conducting a nationwide, voluntary recall of their contraceptive drug, Lunelle(TM). HealthPartners is encouraging all women who use Lunelle, to contact their healthcare provider.
HealthPartners has suspended use of the Lunelle pre-filled syringes and removed all lots of this contraceptive from its inventory as a result of the voluntary recall announcement by Pharmacia. In a news release, Pharmacia listed the reason for the recall of the Lunelle Monthly Contraceptive Injection (medroxyprogesterone acetate and estradiol cypionate injectable suspension) as a risk of contraceptive failure.
HealthPartners is contacting patients who have received these injections in its HealthPartners Medical Group clinics to encourage them to seek a pregnancy test, and to discuss alternative forms of contraception. HealthPartners is advising women who have been using Lunelle as their contraceptive to use an additional form of barrier-method birth control such as male or female condom, diaphragm orspermicide until beginning a new form of hormonal birth control. Patients with questions or concerns about this recall should call 612-333-2229, 24 hours a day for additional assistance.
   "Women who have been using this drug need to talk to their health care provider immediately and need to take a pregnancy test," said Joan Madden, department head of Obstetrics and Gynecology at HealthPartners. "We are working diligently to contact the women using Lunelle and to work with them regarding their contraceptive needs."

Rivals Benefit From Biogen Drug Recall

Updated from 2:25 p.m. EST
The sudden suspension of multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri brought shock to doctors and patients -- but it brought relief to investors in companies whose products faced a challenge from the high-profile drug marketed by Biogen Idec (BIIB:Nasdaq) and Elan (ELN:NYSE).
Analysts on both sides of the Atlantic recalculated their estimates for the biggest players in the MS market after Biogen and Elan pulled Tysabri, which had just entered the U.S. market in November.
After falling 43% Monday, Biogen shares closed up $2.61, or 6.8%, to $41.26 Tuesday. Elan, which tanked 70% Monday, lost 3 cents, or 0.4%, to $7.97 Tuesday.
The drug was removed after the report of one confirmed death and one suspected case of a rare, often fatal disorder among patients in clinical trials who took both Tysabri and Biogen Idec's popular Avonex, the world's bestselling MS drug, which produced $1.4 billion in sales last year. Both patients received combination therapy for more than two years.
Although Elan predicted a quick return to the market for Tysabri -- perhaps in the third quarter -- analysts said the circumstances for the drug's suspension provided opportunities for many existing drugs, including Biogen Idec's Avonex.
Most major players in the MS drug market have some form of licensing, royalty and/or marketing agreements with partners. For example, Serono (SRA:NYSE ADR), the Swiss developer of Rebif, has an alliance with Pfizer (PFE:NYSE). The German company Schering AG (SHR ADR:NYSE) sells its drug Betaseron through its U.S. subsidiary Berlex and it also has a marketing agreement with Chiron (CHIR:NYSE).
Finally, Israel's Teva Pharmaceutical (TEVA:Nasdaq ADR), which sells Copaxone in the U.S., has an arrangement with France's Sanofi-Aventis (SNY:NYSE). All of the foreign companies trade on U.S. markets via American Depositary Receipts, or ADRs.
Many analysts believe Teva will be the most immediate beneficiary of Tysabri's misfortune. Copaxone, which acts differently than the older MS drugs, has forged into second place in the U.S. market with a 32.9% market share, less than one percentage point behind Avonex, according to IMS Health. These data represent an eight-week average through the week ended Feb. 18.
 "Tysabri's efficacy was viewed as a potential threat to Teva's share of the multiple sclerosis market," said Albert L. Rauch, of A.G. Edwards, in a report to clients on Monday. Rauch, who has a hold rating on Teva, said Copaxone will maintain its second-place position even if Tysabri returns to the market. He expects Tysabri would be saddled with a stronger warning label, and thus "a smaller potential." (He doesn't own shares; his firm is a market maker in Teva's stock.)
Tysabri's withdrawal "removes a major overhand for Teva's Copaxone," said Ken Cacciatore of S.G. Cowen, in a report to clients on Tuesday. "We now have greater conviction in continued stable Copaxone growth." He predicts Copaxone will be taken by 32% of U.S. multiple sclerosis patients for the next few years.
Total sales of Copaxone -- U.S. and foreign, Teva and Sanofi-Aventis -- should climb 23% to $1.15 billion in 2005 and then reach $1.5 billion in 2008. Previously, Cacciatore predicted no sales growth during 2006-08. (His firm doesn't make stock predictions. He doesn't own shares; his firm is a market maker in Teva's stock.)
Teva's stock fell 24 cent to $29.87 on Tuesday. The stock climbed $2.55 to $30.11 Monday on trading volume that was nine times greater than the average daily trade for the last three months.
 
Big Boost For Serono
Serono got an upgrade to buy from hold on Monday from Brian White at Deutsche Bank. "Although these are early days in the tribulations of Tysabri, we believe that its voluntary suspension markedly changes the dynamics of the MS market and makes Serono's Rebif less vulnerable to switching [to other drugs]," White said in a research report.
"Moreover, Serono's own efforts to improve Rebif's position versus the other beta-interferons and Copaxone suggests that growth is now more likely even if Tysabri should reappear," said White, who doesn't own shares but whose firm has provided non-investment banking services for Serono.
 The company, he noted, is aided by many years of sales and safety data "with no serious adverse effects." And since the European counterpart of the Food and Drug Administration will wait for the FDA's review of Tysabri, the previously expected entrance of Tysabri into the European Union market in late 2005 is "now too optimistic," he said.
Anticipating "a more benign competitive environment" in all markets, White predicted that Serono's sales of Rebif, which were $1.09 billion last year, could rise to $1.23 billion this year. Previously, he had predicted $1.17 billion for 2005. By 2008, he forecast sales of $1.5 billion vs. his previous prediction of $1.2 billion.
A bullish view of Serono also comes from Jerome Berton of the investment banking firm Natexis Bleichroeder, who told clients Tuesday that Tysabri's setback provides "breathing room" for all of the beta-interferon makers, including Serono, whose Rebif accounted for half of the company's revenue last year.
Berton predicted the withdrawal of Tysabri would allow Rebif to expand its U.S. market share to 19% by the end of 2008 compared to 13% last year.
Backed by Pfizer's marketing clout and a recent clinical trial in which Rebif outperformed Avonex, Berton said Rebif "should become the world leader in 2008, neck and neck with Avonex starting in 2006." (Berton doesn't own shares. His firm doesn't provide stock ratings and it doesn't have an investment banking relationship with Serono.)
On Tuesday, Serono fell 14 cents to $18.45, after jumping $4.05 to $18.59 yesterday. Monday's U.S. trading volume of 2.18 million shares was 21 times the average daily trade for the past three months.
Tysabri also had presented a threat to Betaseron, which is Schering AG's leading product, accounting for 16% of 2004's revenue. Florent Cespedes of Natexis Bleichroeder said Schering "is likely to benefit very little" from Tysabri's withdrawal from the market.
 "Despite its considerable efficacy, Tysabri was a weak threat to Betaseron, which has a long history of safety and a broader indication than its competitors," Cespedes said in a Tuesday research report. "However, it has been on the market since 1993 and shows substantial side effects. We believe these factors will prevent it from advancing any further on the market." (Cespedes doesn't own shares. Natexis Bleichroeder doesn't provide stock ratings and it doesn't have an investment banking relationship).
Still, on Tuesday, Schering's stock rose in U.S. trading by $1.05 to $74.15. On Monday, the lightly traded stock gained $2 to $73.10. Shares of Chiron, which also sells Betaseron, slipped 16 cents on Tuesday to $35.42. On Monday, Chiron's shares advanced 57 cents to $35.58 on volume that was about four times the average daily trade.

Biotech industry seeks image upgrade; Drug recalls hinder growth, conferees say

PHILADELPHIA -- Drug recalls. Prescription drug importation issues. Insurance reimbursement questions.
Those were the buzzwords for the biotechnology industry in the past year. And the effect of those issues has led to two other buzzwords that are being uttered repeatedly this week as industry executives gather for the annual Biotechnology Industry Organization conference: risk intolerance.
Problems that drugs caused for a small percentage of patients are adversely affecting thousands the drugs may have helped, industry insiders say. They worry that the public intolerance of side effects is unrealistic and will lead to more regulation that may keep promising therapies off the market.
"Chances of getting hurt falling in the tub are far greater than taking some of the drugs that were withdrawn from the market, yet there's been no outcry against bathtubs," said Ron Cohen, chief executive of Acorda Therapeutics in New York. He spoke on a panel whose title gave an indication of the grousing that was to take place: "Nobody Expects the Spanish Inquisition; The Biotech Year That Was."
Drugs recalled in the past year as a result of patients becoming sick or dying include Cox 2 inhibitors, such as Vioxx and Celebrex, and the multiple sclerosis drug Tysabri.
Executives said there is risk in almost all drugs. And some asked whether there should be a more careful consideration of whether some drugs were worth keeping on the market despite some level of risk.
"It's impossible for able-bodied individuals to get into the head of the people with a disability," Cohen said. "If many people are helped by a drug might it be worth the risk?"
It seems the public consensus is no.
But Kenneth Moch, chief executive of the New Jersey biotech Altheon, said the result is a layering on of barriers.
"Biotechnology is such a risky business, and only a small number of companies ever get a product to market," Moch said. "By now layering more (regulations) on the companies, it makes it harder and harder to have successes. It's essentially eliminating the bottom of the curve."
Cohen said part of the problem with some of the drugs that have been recalled is that they don't provide a drastic benefit to enough people to warrant consideration of keeping them on the market.
Then there's threat of expensive legal problems, considering the precedents that have already been set in connection with products such as asbestos, said Barclay Phillips of the Vector Late-Stage Equity Fund.
Elliot Parks of the venture capital firm Ventana said the biotech industry as a whole has suffered in the public eye and said that it is a result mostly of products manufactured by pharmaceutical companies, not biotech. The public does not understand the difference between the two industries, he said.
Part of the solution to combating the risk intolerance and poor public perception is education, said Joe Panetta, head of Biocom, the San Diego region's industry trade group. As a former risk assessment manager with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Panetta said he saw how education can combat public intolerance. And he has seen it with previous issues in the biotechnology community, including genetically modified organisms and stem cells.
James Greenwood, head of the national Biotechnology Industry Organization, agreed that education was key to pushing ahead with biotech's growth and development. At a lunch Monday attended by many of the 18,000 people at the conference, Greenwood unveiled a video the trade group commissioned to use as a lobbying tool on Capitol Hill and in statehouses around the country.
On the video, industry insiders and a Nobel laureate explain that biotechnology is more than stem cells. It briefly talks about products used to help clean environmental problems, ecologically sensitive products such as ethanol, diagnostic tests and finally, therapeutics.
It grabs at the heart-strings, too. A woman whose daughter has cystic fibrosis and whose husband has Lou Gehrig's disease talks about how biotechnology gives her family hope.
Many in the industry anticipate the pendulum of public perception to swing back into biotech's favor once many of the therapies now being developed hit the market and start helping people with currently untreatable conditions.
The start of that swing may begin with more widespread use of diagnostic tools from the industry. Those tools will allow doctors to look at a patient's individual genetics and determine when a drug will be effective or when the patient could be one of a small percentage to have harmful side effects, said Greg Lucier of Carlsbad-based Invitrogen.
Invitrogen, which supplies biotech-based tools and kits to help in drug discovery, has taken the swing into account and is looking to help these diagnostics companies, Lucier said yesterday.

HOSPITAL COMPOUNDING CONTRIBUTED TO SPIKE IN DRUG RECALLS IN 2006
FDA Week
November 3, 2006

The number of the most serious drug recalls rose dramatically to 45 this fiscal year from only a handful in previous years, due in part to a cluster of class I recalls of what FDA calls "quasi compounded" drugs that hospitals prepare for surgeries. Sources say a recent ruling in Texas limiting FDA's oversight of compounded drugs is unlikely to curb similar recalls in the future.
In some years there are just one or two class I recalls, says FDA's Joe Famulare, who spoke recently at a Generic Pharmaceutical Association conference. He said many of the recalls this year were for intravenous drugs in hospitals that were not sterile, many of which were used during heart surgery.
Hospitals often must prepare drugs for surgeries, Famulare said. He referred to the practice as quasi compounding. Sources familiar with compounding find the term funny. They say what hospitals do is compounding; there is nothing quasi about it.
They say FDA likely is using the term because the agency backed itself into a corner in a recent court case it lost. In that case, Medical Center Pharmacy, et al v. Gonzales, et al, FDA took the position that any change to a drug, even adding cherry flavoring, is tantamount to an illegal unapproved new drug, but FDA uses its "enforcement discretion" in deciding which drugs to go after.
The sources say hospitals compound drugs all the time and may be the biggest compounders of all. Drugs given intravenously often must be prepared specially for the patient. Such specially prepared intravenous drugs demonstrate how ludicrous FDA's position is, they say, which is why an FDA official might refer to the practice as quasi compounding. It would be impossible for hospitals to get each IV drug approved as a new drug for every patient who walked into the emergency room or scheduled an operation.
The term of art aside, sources agree that the ruling in Medical Center does not affect FDA's ability to spot nonsterile compounded drugs and have them recalled.
Terry Scarborough, who represented the compounding pharmacists in the case against FDA, says the judge ruled that compounded drugs are not new unapproved drugs, and that FDA cannot inspect the books and records of state licensed compounding pharmacies, though technically the inspection part of the ruling applies only to the 10 pharmacies involved in the suit.
However, FDA has always had the clear authority to inspect the equipment, containers, labeling and finished and unfinished product of any facility that holds drugs, Scarborough and others say. These are the kinds of inspections that would turn up nonsterile products.
Scarborough says that what angered compounding pharmacists is that FDA had insisted on access to their books and records, not to inspect the quality of drugs, but to determine how much the pharmacies were making because the agency uses volume to distinguish pharmacies from drug manufacturers. Scarborough contends volume should be used to gauge when a pharmacy is a drug manufacturer.

Prescription drug recalls raise questions about FDA approval process

The government's system for approving drugs has come under renewed scrutiny after a number of widely used medicines have been linked to deaths or serious illness.
Critics say the Food and Drug Administration moves too quickly and puts the drug industry's interests ahead of patient safety. As evidence they point to seven drugs that have been pulled from the market or severely restricted in the past three years. This week alone, the diabetes drug Rezulin and the heartburn drug Propulsid were added to the list.
"The FDA is acting in a reckless way to make sure they are not alienating the industry," said Sidney Wolfe, director of the Public Citizen Health Research Group and a frequent critic of the agency.
FDA officials insist their system works, but they stress all the side effects of drugs cannot be known until after a drug is approved and is taken by tens of thousands of patients. Typically, drugs are only tested on about 3,000 people before getting approved.
"There is no truth to the idea that we are any easier on drug approvals," said Dr. Robert Temple, FDA's associate director for medical policy.
The FDA acknowledges there has been a spate of recalls, but says that when viewed over the course of several years, the percentage of drugs pulled from the market has remained stable.
A spokesman for the drug industry agreed.
Since 1980, there have been 528 medicines approved and only 12, or 2 percent, have been recalled because of safety reasons, said the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America.
"The fact that only 2 percent have been withdrawn shows two things: The benefits of marketed drugs outweighs the risks, and the safety system in place is working," said spokesman Jeff Trewhitt.
The FDA accelerated its drug review process during the 1990s after Congress complained it was taking too long to approve lifesaving medicines.
In the 1980s it usually took almost three years for the agency to approve a drug. Today, the average approval time is one year. For drugs the FDA deems breakthrough medicines, it knocks the review time down to six months.
The acceleration process was shepherded by then-FDA commissioner David Kessler, who now wonders about how far it's gone.
"We have to be mindful that the pendulum has not swung too far," Kessler said Friday.
As drug recalls have made headlines in recent years, Congress has begun to pay closer attention to whether the FDA is doing its job properly.
In January, the General Accounting Office, Congress' investigative arm, concluded the FDA lacks the ability to properly track problems with drugs after they hit the market. The office recommended that pharmacists work more closely with doctors in prescribing and monitoring drugs.
Part of the problem might be related to the drug industry's increased use of consumer advertising, which is spurring more sales of newer drugs. Rapid introduction of new drugs means that doctors have less experience with them before they are taken by millions of people.
"We tend to want to see the upside of pharmaceuticals and tend to forget they all have risks, something we see with the drugs that have been withdrawn," Kessler said.
Wolfe said the FDA has been too reluctant to take drugs off the market once it discovers problems. He said the agency is too reliant on adding warning labels to the drugs - a system that can fail if doctors fail to read them.
Warner-Lambert's Rezulin was approved in 1997 after just six months of government review because regulators deemed it a crucial new therapy. But within a year the drug was linked to serious liver problems and deaths. The FDA placed several restrictions on the drug last year, and on Tuesday the agency decided to ban it altogether.
One key factor in the FDA's decision to ban the drug now was the fact that two alternatives were approved last year, Avandia and Actos.
The FDA also tried to use warning labels to when it discovered problems with Johnson & Johnson's Propulsid. It changed the labeling five times since the drug was approved in 1993 as it learned about new situations when the drug could cause illness or death. On Thursday, with prodding from the FDA, the company said it would stop marketing the drug - which had $950 million in sales in 1999 - and would stop distributing it to drug stores in July.
Instead, J&J will make the pill available for a limited basis to certain patients who cannot take alternative medicines.
Shares of J&J fell $8.75, or 11 percent, to $71.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.

Bayer postpones Wall Street listing after drug recall: Stock hits 29-month low

FRANKFURT - Germany's biggest drugs group Bayer AG yesterday postponed its Wall Street listing until February as U.S. lawsuits related to its recalled Baycol drug hammered its share price.
'We don't want to list our shares on what is for us the world's most important capital market without being able to give convincing answers to the questions that have been raised,' said chief executive Manfred Schneider.
Bayer shares fell more than 6% as investors became concerned the group would have to pay compensation as a result of U.S. class-action lawsuits related to Baycol filed in recent days.
Bayer, one of the last drug conglomerates, said it would strongly contest the suits. The company said that no causal links had been established between the anti-cholesterol drug Baycol and 52 deaths reported to have occurred while patients were taking the drug and said it saw no need to make risk provisions for the lawsuits.
Shares in the Leverkusen-based group dropped to a 29-month low, having shed 28% since Aug. 8, when the company recalled Baycol/Lipobay because of potentially deadly side effects.
Bayer said the the scale of the decline surprised company executives and that markets were overestimating the chances of the lawsuits succeeding.
Bayer said chances were slim Baycol would return to the market.
Bayer's U.S. listing, originally planned for Sept. 26, had been seen as a vital plank in the company's expansion strategy in the world's largest drug market.
Bayer received another blow yesterday when the German health ministry slammed its information policy as unacceptable, saying Bayer had not told it about a potentially damaging study on Baycol until two days after the recall.
Bayer rejected the government's criticism, saying it had informed Berlin of the main points of the study in April. The lawsuits and the delayed listing were the main focus yesterday as Bayer set out to convince investors of the value of its drug business.
'After the Baycol withdrawal they don't have a story anymore,' said Michael Vara, an analyst at Commerzbank in Frankfurt. 'The share is not an acquisition currency right now,' he said, referring to Bayer's plans to bolster its drug business in the United States using stock from the planned listing as an acquisition currency.
'It would be the wisest thing to postpone it [the listing] -- the Bayer share is not an attractive investment right now. The company is in a crisis, which should be its first priority, not a listing,' a Munich-based fund manager said.

Prescription drug recalls raise questions about FDA approval process

The government's system for approving drugs has come under renewed scrutiny after a number of widely used medicines have been linked to deaths or serious illness.
Critics say the Food and Drug Administration moves too quickly and puts the drug industry's interests ahead of patient safety. As evidence they point to seven drugs that have been pulled from the market or severely restricted in the past three years. This week alone, the diabetes drug Rezulin and the heartburn drug Propulsid were added to the list.
"The FDA is acting in a reckless way to make sure they are not alienating the industry," said Sidney Wolfe, director of the Public Citizen Health Research Group and a frequent critic of the agency.
FDA officials insist their system works, but they stress all the side effects of drugs cannot be known until after a drug is approved and is taken by tens of thousands of patients. Typically, drugs are only tested on about 3,000 people before getting approved.
"There is no truth to the idea that we are any easier on drug approvals," said Dr. Robert Temple, FDA's associate director for medial policy.
The FDA acknowledges there has been a spate of recalls, but says that when viewed over the course of several years, the percentage of drugs pulled from the market has remained stable.
A spokesman for the drug industry agreed.
Since 1980, there have been 528 medicines approved and only 12, or 2 percent, have been recalled because of safety reasons, said the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America.
"The fact that only 2 percent have been withdrawn shows two things: The benefits of marketed drugs outweighs the risks, and the safety system in place is working," said spokesman Jeff Trewhitt.
The FDA accelerated its drug review process during the 1990s after Congress complained it was taking too long to approve lifesaving medicines.
In the 1980s it usually took almost three years for the agency to approve a drug. Today, the average approval time is one year. For drugs the FDA deems breakthrough medicines, it knocks the review time down to six months.
The acceleration process was shepherded by then-FDA commissioner David Kessler, who now wonders about how far it's gone.
"We have to be mindful that the pendulum has not swung too far," Kessler said Friday.
As drug recalls have made headlines in recent years, Congress has begun to pay closer attention to whether the FDA is doing its job properly.
In January, the General Accounting Office, Congress' investigative arm, concluded the FDA lacks the ability to properly track problems with drugs after they hit the market. The office recommended that pharmacists work more closely with doctors in prescribing and monitoring drugs.
Part of the problem might be related to the drug industry's increased use of consumer advertising, which is spurring more sales of newer drugs. Rapid introduction of new drugs means that doctors have less experience with them before they are taken by millions of people.
"We tend to want to see the upside of pharmaceuticals and tend to forget they all have risks, something we see with the drugs that have been withdrawn," Kessler said.
Wolfe said the FDA has been too reluctant to take drugs off the market once it discovers problems. He said the agency is too reliant on adding warning labels to the drugs - a system that can fail if doctors fail to read them.
Warner-Lambert's Rezulin was approved in 1997 after just six months of government review because regulators deemed it a crucial new therapy. But within a year the drug was linked to serious liver problems and deaths. The FDA placed several restrictions on the drug last year, and on Tuesday the agency decided to ban it altogether.
One key factor in the FDA's decision to ban the drug now was the fact that two alternatives were approved last year, Avandia and Actos.

MISSISSAUGA, Ont. (CP) -- Several types of inhalers used to deliver medication to asthmatics and others suffering from pulmonary disease are being recalled by the company that manufactures them.Canadian Press
Some Ventolin Diskus, Flovent Diskus and Serevent Diskus brand inhalers could malfunction and not deliver the drugs they are designed to release, GlaxoSmithKline Inc. said in a news release.
The warning refers to certain lots of inhalation devices purchased at pharmacies or given out as samples by doctors.
The company is advising patients who use the inhalers to check the lot numbers of their devices or consult a pharmacist. Any affected inhalers should be returned to a pharmacy for replacement.
The affected lot numbers are:
- Ventolin Diskus 200mcg (DIN 02243115): lot numbers 073, 081, 094, and 105 expiring between April and November 2004.
- Serevent Diskus 50mcg (DIN 02231129): lot numbers 491, 496, 527, 537, 550 and 556 expiring between June 2004 and January 2005.
- Flovent Diskus 50mcg (DIN 02237244): lot numbers 122, 138 and 146 expiring between December 2003 and July 2004.
- Flovent Diskus 100mcg (DIN 02237245): lot numbers 346 and 397 expiring between January and April 2004.
- Flovent Diskus 250mcg (DIN 02237246): lot numbers 305, 325, 347, 354, 356, 360 and 375 expiring between December 2003 and July 2004.
- Flovent Diskus 500mcg (DIN 02237247): lot numbers 579, 600, 605, 608, 614 and 615 expiring between December 2003 and June 2004.
The products were recalled because of a fault during the manufacturing process, which has since been resolved, the company said.
Metered dose inhalers or the spray form of the products are not affected by the manufacturing defect.

Bayer Corp. issues partial drug recall as FDA investigates possible tampering

U.S. federal regulators said Friday they are investigating allegations that at least 13 vials of an immune deficiency treatment drug made by Bayer Corp. may have been tampered with by someone outside the company.
Bayer said someone diluted at least 13 vials of its liquid drug Gamimune N with saline.
The company is recalling about 8,000 of the vials distributed across America, and the Food and Drug Administration is investigating.
Bayer said it knew of no patients harmed by the diluted drug, and was unsure what effects it would have on a patient. Bayer said it believes the tampering occurred after the drug left its North Carolina plant and is limited to two lots handled by a single distributor, which the company refused to identify.
Gamimune N is used by about 20,000 patients with weakened immune systems, including bone marrow transplant recipients.
Bayer makes two million vials of Gamimune N each year.
The FDA said it is comfortable with Bayer's limited recall decision.
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania-based Bayer Corp. is a subsidiary of German conglomerate Bayer AG. The company voluntarily removed the anti-cholesterol treatment Baycol from the U.S. market last August after the FDA linked it to 31 deaths.

Canadian drug maker recalls medications after U.S. warning.

OTTAWA - Canadian generic drug giant Apotex voluntarily recalled some of its drugs late Thursday following a Health Canada investigation launched last July into the company's manufacturing practices.
The investigation was initiated after U.S. regulators found ``significant deviations'' from good manufacturing practices during an inspection at Apotex's Toronto plant.
Canwest News Service was the first to report in July that Health Canada would be doing their own review into the findings by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
In a news release, Health Canada said Thursday the recall applies to three lots of drugs including Apo-Amilzide (5 to 50 mg), Apo-Meloxicam (7.5 and 15 mg) and Apo-Ranitidine (75 and 150 mg).
These medications are used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, excess stomach acid or liver cirrhosis.
Health Canada said that it will continue to inspect the Apotex facilities for the next few weeks to ensure that there is compliance.
It urges any Canadians currently taking the drugs to contact their family doctor.
The FDA warned Apotex in June that officials would begin blocking drugs at the border by the Toronto-based company if it did not begin complying with good manufacturing practices, which are universally accepted standards for product quality control.
The U.S. regulator said it found that the company did not follow regulations in the manufacturing of ``non-sterile oral solid dosage drug products'' causing the products to be ``adulterated'' within the meaning of the U.S. legislation, according to a letter dated June 25.
Outstanding issues flagged in the FDA warning letter include Apotex's failure to thoroughly investigate the failure of a batch to meet its specifications and whether the batch had already been distributed.
In total, Apotex rejected 554 batches of different drugs over a two-year period, including multiple batches of ``therapeutically significant'' drugs to relieve pain, prevent seizures and treat the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis.
In addition, the letter outlines problems at Apotex's quality control unit to conduct thorough and prompt investigations, and a delay in reporting problems to the FDA.
Apotex is the largest Canadian-owned pharmaceutical company. It produces more than 260 generic drugs which are distributed in Canada and exported to more than 115 countries.

Arthritis drug Vioxx recalled

TRENTON, N.J. (AP-CP) -- Vioxx, the blockbuster arthritis drug taken by tens of millions of people, was pulled from the market by its maker Thursday after a study found it doubled the risk of heart attacks and strokes.
Experts advised patients to immediately stop taking Vioxx, which was developed in Canada over a period of more than a decade, and talk to their doctors about alternatives.
"Given the availability of alternative therapies, and the questions raised by the data, we concluded that a voluntary withdrawal is the responsible course to take," said Ray V. Gilmartin, chairman, president and chief executive of Merck & Co.
Health Canada was among the regulatory bodies that approved the drug in 1999. Information from IMS Health, a private organization that tracks drug dispensing trends, shows that there were more than 3.3 million prescriptions for Vioxx in Canada last year -- making it the 10th most prescribed drug in 2003.
"What is important for Canadians to know is if they're on this medication, they should contact their family physician," Health Canada spokeswoman Jirina Vlk said in Ottawa.
"Every drug has a benefit versus a risk, so do the benefits outweigh the risks?" Vlk said. "Now we have new safety data that tops the balance."
Dr. Arthur Bookman, chair of the Arthritis Society's Medical Advisory Committee in Toronto, said patients shouldn't be concerned about stopping Vioxx abruptly.
The news of Vioxx's dangers came five years after Merck put the drug on the market with great fanfare. Vioxx has since become one of the world's most aggressively marketed drugs, advertised in magazines and in TV commercials, with celebrity endorsements from former athletes Dorothy Hamill and Bruce Jenner.
The withdrawal marks a serious blow to New Jersey-based Merck, the world's third-largest drug maker. Vioxx accounted for $2.5 billion US in worldwide sales in 2003, and has been taken by 84 million people worldwide since its introduction. An estimated two million people are now using it.
Last year, retail sales of the drug in Canada were $194.5 million.
Vioxx, which is also prescribed for acute pain and disorders such as carpal tunnel syndrome, is seen as a potential cancer-prevention medicine as well. In fact, the recall was prompted by a three-year study aimed at showing that the drug could prevent the recurrence of potentially cancerous polyps in the colon and rectum.
Participants taking Vioxx for more than 18 months were found to be twice as likely as those given dummy pills to suffer a heart attack, stroke or other heart complications.
In Montreal, where the drug was developed, medical director Dr. Ernest Pregent said everyone at Merck Frosst Canada Ltd. was in a "low mood."
"Everybody is quite surprised and quiet also -- at the same time saying, `Well OK, we're there for patients.' So we understand that if there's any kind of increased risk ... we're happy that Merck decided to be responsible and say pull out of this medication."
Pregent said Canadian patients with leftover pills should keep them "because the company will establish a reimbursement with pharmacists."
Communications manager Marlene Gauthier said 76 Canadian patients were among those enrolled in the international study that led to discovery of the increased risk. The Canadians were at three centres in Montreal and two in Toronto, but Gauthier said she didn't know if any of those patients experienced heart attacks or strokes during the trial. There were no deaths, she said.
In the study that was halted, 45 of the 1,287 people taking Vioxx had heart attacks or other cardiovascular problems versus 25 out of the 1,299 who got dummy pills, Merck reported. That translated to 3.5 per cent of patients on the drug and only 1.9 per cent on placebo, according to the FDA.
The Food and Drug Administration said there were early signs of potential problems with Vioxx. A Merck study led to warnings about heart risks being placed on the drug's label in 2001, and the FDA has been monitoring problems that have been reported since then.
"This is not a total surprise," said Dr. Steven Galson, acting director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.
Vioxx is part of a class of anti-inflammatory drugs called cox-2 inhibitors that have been heavily touted by the pharmaceutical industry as being more effective and having fewer side-effects, particularly on the stomach, than older drugs. Pfizer's Celebrex and Bextra are also cox-2 inhibitors. But so far, there has been no evidence that these other drugs pose any dangers to the heart.
Officials do not yet know how Vioxx may be causing the increased risk.
Alternatives to Vioxx include generic pain relievers such as ibuprofen and ASA, as well as Celebrex.
"There are very few patients for whom there won't be a good alternative drug," said Dr. Steven Abramson, director of rheumatology at New York University Hospital for Joint Diseases.
Abramson said there is no reason for those who used Vioxx in the past to panic; he said there is no evidence that the elevated risk of heart attack persists after a patient has stopped taking the drug.
Personal-injury lawyers have already begun circling Merck, with at least one announcing plans for a class-action lawsuit. Another claimed he already represents 58 patients around the country allegedly harmed by Vioxx, including people who suffered a heart attack, stroke, internal bleeding or kidney failure.
"It's a disaster for Merck, coming at the worst time," said health-care analyst Hemant Shah of HKS & Co. in Warren, N.J.
Merck stock plunged $12.07 US, or nearly 27 per cent, to close at $33 US in extremely heavy trading, wiping out $28 billion US in market value. Merck also dragged down the Dow Jones industrial average, which was off by more than 55 points.

TORONTO (CP) _ One lot of an over-the-counter dietary supplement sold in the United States and distributed in Canada is being recalled because it contains a prescription drug used in the treatment of obesity.
Health Canada issued an advisory to notify the public of the U.S. recall of one lot of Metaboslim Apple Cider Vinegar because it has been found to contain sibutramine, an appetite suppressant.
Health Canada said Metaboslim's manufacturer, Confidence Inc., has confirmed that some of the affected bottles have been distributed in Canada, even though the products are not authorized for sale in this country. The department is working with the importer to determine where the product was sold and to ensure that it is immediately removed from the market.
The product being recalled is Lot Number 3001006.EXP.102009. The affected Metaboslim product is sold in a plastic bottle with white and red labelling and contains 60 gelatin capsules.
People taking sibutramine should be monitored by a physician as the drug can cause serious side-effects, including cardiovascular reactions such as increased blood pressure, chest pain, and stroke. The drug may also interact with a number of other medications.
Sibutramine should not be taken by people who have had a heart attack, coronary artery disease, heart-related chest pain, irregular heart beats, congestive heart failure, a stroke or symptoms of a stroke. People with unstable or poorly controlled high blood pressure, or who are depressed or suffering from have a psychiatric illness, also should not take the drug.
As well, women who are pregnant, breastfeeding or planning to become pregnant shouldn't take sibutramine, the advisory noted.
People who have the recalled product are asked to immediately discontinue its use and consult their health-care professional if they have concerns. Consumers should return the product to the point of purchase.

Merck CEO says its voluntary recall of Vioxx drug was ethical choice.

Byline: Kim Norris
Nov. 11--The CEO of Merck & Co. Inc. said its actions regarding its arthritis drug, Vioxx, illustrate the principles and ethics of the New Jersey drug company that voluntarily withdrew the blockbuster medicine from the market in September.
What Merck did "is a very clear demonstration of the values of the company -- that the patients come first," Merck CEO Raymond Gilmartin told the Free Press on Wednesday. In the largest drug recall in history, Merck withdrew Vioxx on Sept. 30 after a company-sponsored trial found people who took the medication for more than 18 months doubled their risk of heart attack or stroke.
Gilmartin was in Ann Arbor to deliver a speech Wednesday on ethics at the Stephen M. Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan.
"Ethics is all about behavior," Gilmartin said. "It's not about what people say about you . . . What matters at the end of the day is what you did."
Not everyone agrees that Merck has acted ethically.
What Merck did -- and didn't do -- has been the topic of considerable debate and multiple lawsuits even before Merck voluntarily withdrew Vioxx, effectively killing its fourth-largest product, responsible for $2.5 billion in annual sales.
Since withdrawing Vioxx -- a move that caused the company's stock to lose 27 percent of its value that day -- Gilmartin has been on a mission to contain the damage by presenting the drug company's accounting of events. Merck shares rose 41 cents to $26.41 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Wednesday. Merck shares have fallen 43 percent this year.
A Nov. 1 Wall Street Journal report suggested that Merck knew about the dangers of Vioxx as early as 2000 and not only hid that knowledge but actively discouraged employees and academic researchers from publicizing the potential risks.
On Monday, Merck revealed in filings that it is being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department in relation to Vioxx. The company warned that the results of the inquiries could be unfavorable and "could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position, liquidity and results of operations."
Gilmartin noted that the documents used by the Journal to support its story were culled from millions of Merck documents by lawyers representing people suing the drug maker and were intended to "misrepresent the facts, our policies and our business practices."
With the precision of a man who has done this many times before, Gilmartin recreates the history of Vioxx, from its introduction to the public in 1999 to its withdrawal in September. In between, studies on the drug were conducted, but they either were not designed to scrutinize the drug's effect on cardiovascular systems, or their results were conflicting, he said.
When the results of an internal three-year controlled clinical study indicated that people taking Vioxx for more than 18 months showed a marked increase in cardiovascular problems, Merck acted swiftly to withdraw the drug from the market, Gilmartin said.
"These are the facts." Gilmartin summarizes. "Nothing obscures what we really did. The decision was in the sole interest of the patient," Gilmartin said. "We did not have to voluntarily withdraw the drug.
"Not only did the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) commend us for voluntarily withdrawing Vioxx, but it noted in its press release that the risk for any individual from the drug is small."
Merck, which employs 64,000 people worldwide, has been recognized as a model of corporate ethics and responsibility. In 2003, Merck was awarded top honors for corporate stewardship from U.S. Commerce Secretary Donald Evans and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. And the Economist magazine noted that Merck has "won the admiration of advocates of corporate responsibility" and is considered the "acceptable face of capitalism."
Upon arriving at Merck in 1994, Gilmartin established the position of chief ethics officer. The company created a global code of conduct and holds ongoing training and workshops. There also is an advice line for employees to call in with questions or concerns and ombudsmen in key places in the United States.
More than 350 Vioxx lawsuits have been filed against Merck already, although none has gone to court or been settled. And many more are expected. Gilmartin said he is confident Merck will prevail in its defense of lawsuits that have been and are likely to be filed.
"We are able to demonstrate in every step of the way that we were diligent and responsive," he said. "We did the right thing and as soon as we had new information we moved quickly to withdraw," he said.
Among the other things Gilmartin addressed in the interview:
There is no prospect the company will cut its dividend. "We're very strong financially," Gilmartin said. "We have a strong balance sheet and strong cash flows."
He does not expect the company to "do anything draconian" in terms of laying off workers or freezing salaries in the wake of the loss of $2.5 billion in annual revenue from lost Vioxx sales. The approximately 1,000 Vioxx sales representatives in the United States will be redeployed for other Merck medications.
More dollars -- and a larger percentage of revenue -- will be invested in research and development, despite the loss of revenue and potential costs of fighting lawsuits. The company has traditionally invested 12 to 15 percent, or about $4 billion last year in R&D.
The FDA has asked for additional data on the long-term safety of another Merck pain reliever, called Arcoxia, which could delay its release in the United States. The drug is on the market in 48 countries and is awaiting FDA approval in the United States.
The company continues to conduct studies to determine why Vioxx had the cardiovascular effects it had.

NEW YORK, June 5  /PRNewswire/ -- IAG Research, the TV ad effectiveness ratings company, today revealed the latest syndicated data for the best new prescription drug ads that have premiered thus far this TV season.  The latest ads stemming from Sepracor's highly successful "luna moth" campaign keep prescription sleep aid, Lunesta, at the top of the charts.   Lunesta's currently airing ads, featuring the "7-night challenge," are the most memorable among adults, as well as the most recognized prescription drug brand advertised on broadcast primetime TV.
Lunesta's advertising captures the #1 and #2 ranking and are recalled over 50 percent more than the average new prescription ad launched so far this TV season.
"The fact that Lunesta keeps topping the charts is a true testament to strong campaign development that continues to deliver seamless creative extensions that effectively break-through the clutter and reinforce the brand identity synonymous with the presence of the luna moth," said Ms. Fariba Zamaniyan, Sr. Vice President of IAG Research's Pharmaceutical Practice.  "But one question that is on many people's minds is, how long will Lunesta continue at the top?"
Interestingly enough, this TV season a newcomer emerged, demonstrating how an ad campaign can take a risk with its creative approach to break-through and differentiate itself.  Rozerem, the prescription sleep aid drug marketed by Takeda, has received an abundant amount of criticism for its unconventional campaign featuring Abraham Lincoln and a talking beaver, but was still able to claim the #4 spot on the list of top five most recalled new prescription drug ads with its second creative, "Bus Stop."
"Despite criticism for an approach that sets itself apart from the more traditional pharmaceutical ads, who can argue the success Rozerem has had in being recalled," added Zamaniyan.
Also worth noting is that the latest ad from the direct-to-consumer Rx advertising veteran, Zyrtec, captures the #3 ranking with its latest installation within the "dream house" campaign.  Zyrtec is marketed by Pfizer Pharmaceuticals for the treatment of seasonal and perennial allergies.
For the first time, there was a tie for fifth place on IAG's top five most recalled new prescription drug ad ranking.  Crestor, AstraZeneca's first-line drug therapy used to lower cholesterol, and Vytorin, marketed by Merck/Schering-Plough also for the treatment of high cholesterol, received identical scores for viewers' ability to recall the ads during this past TV season.
"Prescription drug advertising is fundamentally no different than advertising for other product classes," said Zamaniyan.  "The keys to success continue to reside in the basic principles of advertising.  Unique copy, relevant storylines, strong branding, effective tie-in of product benefit and sometimes humor are just some of the attributes that make ads memorable and motivating to target audiences.  These top performers are strong examples of how to implement these basic principles within the rigid guidelines faced by this category of advertising."

   Methodology for this Report
The data within this ranking is based on 24-hour viewer recall of new prescription drug ads launched within the 2006/07 TV season (09.01.06 -- 04.01.07). Prime media weight is equivalized across ads and the ranking then compiled. Data is limited to survey responses among adults 18+ and includes TV airings on Broadcast Prime only. This data excludes airings of all 15 second reminder ads and includes both sports and non-sports programming. The rankings are calculated based on an index of ad and brand recall for each new ad versus the mean score for all new ads that aired during this period. Sample minimums are applied.

MS patient's hope shattered by recall of new drug.

Highlight: Biogen Idec and Elan Corp.'s multiple sclerotic drug Tysabri
Body




Byline: Desonta Holder
Mar. 8--In January, Gloria Ouang started using Tysabri for multiple sclerosis.
After 11 years of struggling with a limp leg, numbness, tingling and loss of mobility, the drug offered Ouang great hope.
"The other day, I was listening to a salsa CD, and I wanted to dance, but how? I held onto the door, and I was dancing."
Last week, however, the drug's manufacturer and distributor -- Biogen Idec and Elan Corp. -- pulled Tysabri off the market after a patient died from a rare and deadly neurological disorder that attacked the brain.
The drug, administered intravenously once a month in a doctor's office, had been viewed as a promising new treatment for MS. Relapse rates for MS had declined by two-thirds among those who took the drug in clinical trials over the past two years.
Relapses are a critical issue in MS, an autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system. About 400,000 people in the United States have MS -- mostly women ages 20 to 40. With a relapse, a person may temporarily lose vision in one eye, experience vertigo or develop numbness on one side of the body. Other complications include speech loss and incontinence. Over time, some of the symptoms remain.
"A relapse can take someone from being fully functional at work to not being able to walk," said Dr. Jeffrey Horstmyer, director of the Multiple Sclerosis Center at Mercy Hospital in Coconut Grove.
Tysabri worked differently from other MS drugs in that it helped prevent immune system cells from entering the brain. In MS, a person's immune system attacks itself.
The two companies pulled the drug after two patients using it -- in combination with the MS drug Avonex -- suffered severe reactions.
One patient died after developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, or PML, a disease of the central nervous system that destroys the protective sheath around the brain. Another patient also contracted PML, which usually results in death in six months or less.
For now, experts say MS patients should continue using other drugs, which involve beta interferon, a protein that helps prevent the immune system from attacking the brain.
But interferons require patients to inject themselves -- sometimes up to three times a week. (Tysabri required only once-a-month doses).
"I felt like a strainer," says Ouang, 43, who had to inject herself thrice weekly. "I was on fire."
Ouang contracted MS when she was 32. Her children, now grown, were 8 and 10 when she was diagnosed.
For Ouang, as with many MS patients, it started with numbness in one leg. Soon, she was dragging that leg. After slipping in her bathroom and injuring her knee, she began using a cane.
"I liked to dance and go to the beach, but not now," she said. She also worked as an insurance salesperson. Today she is disabled, lives alone and maintains her home with the help of a cleaning woman.
As her leg became weaker, she used the interferons.
However, the side effects -- fever, chills, fatigue -- along with the painful injections were too much for Ouang: 'One day I said, 'I don't want this any more." I went two years without the medication and my condition seemed to not get any worse."
But "the disease is much more active than the patient can tell you," Horstmyer said. "You follow an MS patient for a year and you'll see new lesions on an MRI."
Ouang knew it wasn't wise to halt medication, so when she heard about Tysabri, she gave it a try and encountered no side effects.
After two treatments, she gained more control of her leg. She was able to wriggle her ankle and bend her leg back while lying down.
And now, "I walk without my cane where I know my environment, like at home, and I do a lot of things I couldn't do before.
Several of Horstmyer's patients reported "impressive improvements" after using Tysabri, he said. "There was a gentleman on an interferon three times a week. Every time he took the injection, he became ill. This meant 10 or 12 days a month he was impaired, but with Tysabri, that went away.
"The recent report about the safety of Tysabri does not question the known clinical benefits," Horstmyer said. The question is "whether or not there is a newly identified rare complication."
Tysabri's marketers are investigating the death and going back over data from the clinical trials. MS experts said they don't know whether the drug will return to the market, which concerns Ouang.
"I am frustrated because [Tysabri] has made a big difference in my life and I don't want to stop taking it," she said.

Recall of anti-cholesterol drug sparks numerous calls to MDs

Bayer Pharmaceutical Company's recent decision to pull the cholesterol-lowering drug Baycol off the market Wednesday has caused some people to panic and sparked a flurry of calls to doctors' offices.
Baycol has been linked to 31 cases of muscle weakness in Canadian users, including one death. Three Cambridge area people have been hospitalized after taking the medication. And there have been reports in the U.S. that the drug has been linked to more than 30 deaths.
TORSTAR NEWS SERVICE
The worldwide withdrawal followed increasing reports of the drug's side-effects, especially in patients who have been taking Gemfibrozil, another cholesterol-lowering drug, at the same time.
Dr. A. Shekhar Pandey, a cardiologist with Cambridge Memorial Hospital, is concerned people are panicking. The removal of Baycol from the shelves doesn't impact other cholesterol-lowering drugs, he said.
"People using Baycol shouldn't necessarily stop taking the drug immediately. It should be approached systematically."
Pandey wants patients who are using this drug to contact their physicians so they can get their blood checked and have their condition assessed.
Physicians can then switch patients to an appropriate substitute drug.
The side-effect from Baycol, known as rhabdomyolyis, causes inflammation of the muscles. The muscles release enzymes that go out into the bloodstream which can affect other organs, Pandey said.
Symptoms include muscle cramps and weakness, fever, malaise, fatigue, nausea and vomiting.
"People who experience these symptoms should be seen more urgently," he said.
Pandey said the three Cambridge-area people were hospitalized, treated and are doing well. It's not known what hospital they were admitted to.
Despite the problems with Baycol, Pandey emphasized the value of other cholesterol-lowering drugs. "It's a very valuable drug that helps save lives," he said.
Pandey is urging patients who use Baycol to contact the physician who prescribed the drug for more information.
People can also contact Bayer Canada at 1-800-265-7382.

Corona, Calif.-Based Company Could Benefit from Thyroid Drug Recall

A possible recall of a major thyroid drug could be a boon to Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. in Corona, which makes a competing product.
Illinois-based Abbott Laboratories Inc. is battling the Food and Drug Administration over its thyroid drug Synthroid, which -- in an unusual oversight spanning roughly 40 years -- never received official approval from the FDA. The end result could be the drug's removal from shelves.
Watson (NYSE: WPI) produces a rival thyroid treatment called Unithroid in an alliance with New York-based Jerome Stevens Pharmaceuticals.
According to The Wall Street Journal, U.S. Rep. Ken Calvert, R-Corona, contacted Watson to see whether it would be able to keep up with possible rising demand for Unithroid if a Synthroid recall develops. Unidentified Watson officials reportedly indicated plans are in place to increase production if necessary.
"I think it's been stepping up production," Michel Feldman, a member of Watson's board of directors and a lawyer at D'Ancona & Pflaum LLC in Chicago, said of the local pharmaceutical maker.
Both Watson and Tennessee-based King Pharmaceuticals make products that compete with Synthroid.
The two companies could potentially handle the increase in demand if Synthroid is removed, Feldman said.
"We knew about (Synthroid's problems) when we bought the product," he said.
In a June 6 release, Calvert said he was encouraged by his discussions with Watson that it can meet an increase in demand for hyperthyroid drugs, "which (are) critical to the continued health needs of millions of Americans."
Thyroid hormones are essential for normal growth and intellectual development in children, according to the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.
The publicity energized investors. Watson stock jumped $3.19 to close at $63.29 June 1. On June 6, it closed at $63.03.
Investment brokerage Morgan Stanley upgraded its rating on Watson's stock from "outperform" to "strong buy" after news of Synthroid's difficulties.
Nevertheless, the FDA has not yet determined whether other thyroid treatments, such as Watson's Unithroid, are interchangeable with Synthroid, Abbott officials said in a prepared release.
"These products have not been determined to be therapeutically equivalent by FDA," the release said. Abbott officials did not return phone calls.
Synthroid has been marketed in the United States for more than 40 years. But thyroid hormone replacement products have become associated with stability and potency problems that have resulted in product recalls and have the potential for serious health consequences, according to the FDA.
In 1997, the FDA called for all manufacturers of levothyroxine sodium products to either submit new applications or show that their products are not new drugs.
Abbott Laboratories acquired the rights to Synthroid through its acquisition of BASF Pharma Knoll, where the drug had been under FDA scrutiny.Copyright 2001 Business PressKnight-Ridder/Tribune Business NewsCopyright 2001 Business PressKnight-Ridder/Tribune Business News433

Recall firm grows beyond drug roots; NNC Group's system finds many applications
Indianapolis Business Journal
May 6, 2002

The challenge: Inform 70,000 U.S. pharmacists, overnight, about a drug recall. Make certain the recall meets Food and Drug Administration standards. And keep the story off the 11 o'clock news to prevent a public panic.
With little fanfare, NNC Group has learned to do all that and more. Large pharmaceutical firms were its first clients. But stockbrokers have found applications for its system. So have politicians.
The pharmaceutical companies desperately want to do the right thing, but they want to do it in a manner that preserves their relationships with the pharmacies and consumers, said NNC President and CEO Tom Willson. And all the things that were important for recalls, it turns out, for other business problems, were pretty important, too.
Founded in 1994 as National Notification Center, NNC was the brainchild of Mike McConnell, a longtime Eli Lilly and Co. executive, after he watched his company endure a significant recall. He was asked to study how Lilly might better handle future recalls.
The conclusion was considered cost-prohibitive. And the reasons make sense.
No pharmaceutical company is ever going to be good at product recalls. If you're good, it means you're doing too many, he said.
Realizing recalls would be an ideal service for drugmakers to outsource, McConnell quit Lilly, brought in a partner and began building something that didn't exist at the time: a system to nearly simultaneously broadcast a message to tens of thousands of people via e-mail, phone and fax. His system also needed to confirm that those messages were received. And it had to document the quick physical return and destruction of hazardous drugs.
It was easier than expected. By the end of 1995, NNC performed its first test recall. It worked so well that NNC now holds several UPS one-day shipping records. But convincing nine of the nation's 10 largest pharmaceutical companies that a tiny start-up could handle such sensitive matters took much longer.
We kind of had the nave idea that if you build the better mousetrap, the world would beat a path to your door, McConnell said. Well, we built the better mousetrap and the challenge was to convince people it was better.
Depending on their extent, recalls can cost from a few thousand to millions of dollars. But few firms consider them in their financial calculations, since they should be infrequent at most.
No one wants to plan around failure, Willson said. If you're a company that only does one recall a year, you don't get very good at it. But just one misstep and the cost is astronomical.
Over eight years, NNC has grown to 60 employees and tens of millions in annual sales, Willson said. Last year, its revenue expanded 98 percent over 2000, and NNC expects similar growth this year. 2001 was NNC's first year with a significant profit, he said.
Much of that expansion has been outside NNC's pharmaceutical customer base. Other markets, including consumer products, need to engineer recalls. And NNC's system, with its ability to quickly disseminate information to a great number of people and confirm they've received it, is attractive to analysts and stockbrokers, for whom time literally is money. Politicians also like its potential to reach registered voters.
We said we're going to get established first in the pharmaceutical industry, and then try to leverage that reputation, said John Barnard, Barnard Associates Inc. CEO who is an NNC investor and board member. If it meets pharmaceutical standards, it'll meet virtually any other industry standards.
Kevin Schroeder, business/technology manager for Unilever Consumer Services North America, is an NNC customer, but he said recall services are the least significant thing he purchases. Unilever has found more uses for NNC's interactive voice response programs and its call center applications.
They were a small company that was extremely responsive to our needs, dedicated resources to projects that we had, and never said no, he said. I look into my wish glass, mention it to them and they say, aWe can do that.' If I can dream it up, they can build it.
Managed growth and flexibility has been the foundation of NNC's success, Barnard said. Opportunities in new markets are always attractive, but realistic growth plans kept NNC from going the way of many a failed dot-com wonder.
A lot of the successful [firms] are able to adapt. Sometimes, if people are too focused on their original mission and can't see other opportunities, they either create a small business or they fail, Barnard said.A

Merck recalls major arthritis drug because it raises heart attack risk

Vioxx, the blockbuster arthritis drug heavily promoted on TV and taken by tens of millions of people, was pulled from the market by its maker Thursday after a study found it doubled the risk of heart attacks and strokes.
Experts advised patients to immediately stop taking Vioxx and talk to their doctors about alternatives.
"Given the availability of alternative therapies, and the questions raised by the data, we concluded that a voluntary withdrawal is the responsible course to take," said Ray V. Gilmartin, chairman, president and chief executive of Merck & Co.
The news of Vioxx's dangers came five years after Merck put the drug on the market with great fanfare. Vioxx has since become one of the world's most aggressively marketed drugs, advertised in magazines and in TV commercials, with celebrity endorsements from former athletes Dorothy Hamill and Bruce Jenner.
The withdrawal marks a serious blow to Whitehouse Station-based Merck, the world's third-largest drug maker. Vioxx accounted for $2.5 billion in worldwide sales in 2003, and has been taken by 84 million people worldwide since its introduction. An estimated 2 million people are now using it.
Merck stock plunged $12.07, or nearly 27 percent, to close at $33 in extremely heavy trading, wiping out $28 billion in market value. Merck also dragged down the Dow Jones industrial average, which was off by more than 55 points.
Vioxx, which is also prescribed for acute pain and disorders such as carpal tunnel syndrome, is seen as a potential cancer-prevention medicine as well. In fact, the recall was prompted by a three-year study aimed at showing that the drug could prevent the recurrence of potentially cancerous polyps in the colon and rectum.
Participants taking Vioxx for more than 18 months were found to be twice as likely as those given dummy pills to suffer a heart attack, stroke or other heart complications.
The Food and Drug Administration said there were early signs of potential problems with Vioxx. A Merck study led to warnings about heart risks being placed on the drug's label in 2001, and the FDA has been monitoring problems that have been reported since then.
"This is not a total surprise," said Dr. Steven Galson, acting director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.
Vioxx is part of a class of anti-inflammatory drugs called cox-2 inhibitors that have been heavily touted by the pharmaceutical industry as being more effective and having fewer side effects, particularly on the stomach, than older drugs. Pfizer's Celebrex and Bextra are also cox-2 inhibitors. But so far there has been no evidence that these other drugs pose any dangers to the heart.
Officials do not yet know how Vioxx may be causing the increased risk.
Alternatives to Vioxx include generic pain relievers such as ibuprofen and aspirin, as well as Celebrex.
"There are very few patients for whom there won't be a good alternative drug," said Dr. Steven Abramson, director of rheumatology at New York University Hospital for Joint Diseases.
Abramson said there is no reason for those who used Vioxx in the past to panic; he said there is no evidence that the elevated risk of heart attack persists after a patient has stopped taking the drug.
In the study that was halted, 45 of the 1,287 people taking Vioxx had heart attacks or other cardiovascular problems versus 25 out of the 1,299 who got dummy pills, Merck reported. That translated to 3.5 percent of patients on the drug and only 1.9 percent on placebo, according to the FDA.
Personal-injury lawyers have already begun circling Merck, with at least one announcing plans for a class-action lawsuit. Another claimed he already represents 58 patients around the country allegedly harmed by Vioxx, including people who suffered a heart attack, stroke, internal bleeding or kidney failure.
"It's a disaster for Merck, coming at the worst time," said health care analyst Hemant Shah of HKS & Co. in Warren, N.J.
Merck said patients with leftover pills can mail them back to the company for a refund. Vioxx is costly, with a 30-day supply costing about $100, far more than generic pain relievers.
Vioxx was the 20th-best-selling drug in the United States last year, accounting for $1.8 billion in sales. But sales dipped 18 percent in the second quarter of this year to $653 million, partly because of increasing concerns about the drug's safety.
Merck also is faced with the 2006 expiration of its patent for Zocor, a cholesterol drug that is its best-selling product. Sales are expected to plunge when generic competition begins.
Merck's announcement stands to benefit rival Pfizer, the world's biggest drug maker. The two companies have been battling for market share, with Pfizer's Celebrex dominating the market with about $2.6 billion in U.S. sales alone last year.
Vioxx's removal also will be a blow to hopes that it and other cox-2 inhibitors could be used to prevent cancer in people at high risk of developing it. A landmark study in 2002 showed that small, daily doses of aspirin could prevent colon cancer, and studies hinted that cox-2 inhibitors might do the same, perhaps without aspirin's side effects.
The FDA on Sept. 8 approved the use of Vioxx for rheumatoid arthritis in children as small as 2 years old and 22 pounds. FDA officials said Thursday that no safety problems have been found among children using the drug.

Bayer Corp. issues partial drug recall as FDA investigates possible tampering

Federal regulators said Friday night they are investigating allegations that at least 13 vials of an immune deficiency treatment drug made by Bayer Corp. may have been tampered with by someone outside the company.
Bayer said someone diluted at least 13 vials of its liquid drug Gamimune N with saline. The company is recalling about 8,000 of the vials distributed nationwide, and the Food and Drug Administration is investigating.
Bayer said it knew of no patients harmed by the diluted drug, and was unsure what effects it would have on a patient.
Gamimune N is used by about 20,000 patients with weakened immune systems, including bone marrow transplant recipients.
Bayer said it believes the tampering occurred after the drug left its North Carolina plant and is limited to two lots handled by a single distributor, which the company refused to identify.
"We have really isolated this incident to the two lots," said company vice president Michael Fournel. "We have no reason to believe the other lots are affected."
Bayer makes two million vials of Gamimune N each year.
The FDA said it is comfortable with Bayer's limited recall decision.
"I think at this point the information indicates that the actions taken by Bayer are appropriate," said Steve Masiello, director of the office of compliance and biologics quality.
Bayer said customer complaints earlier this year that their vials of Gamimune N contained uncharacteristically cloudy liquid prompted it to recall one lot on Feb. 1. Fournel said the company has since received 500 vials from that first lot. Several of those vials showed obvious signs of tampering, Fournel said.
Bayer began recalling the second lot Thursday. Fournel said the company waited that long because it didn't conclude until Monday that someone had tampered with the drugs.
Earlier this month, a Kansas City, Mo., pharmacist pleaded guilty to diluting two chemotherapy drugs made by Eli Lilly and Co. and Bristol-Myers Squibb. Prosecutors said Robert Courtney made hundreds of dollars extra per dose.
Pittsburgh-based Bayer Corp. is a subsidiary of German conglomerate Bayer AG. The company voluntarily removed the anti-cholesterol treatment Baycol from the U.S. market last August after the FDA linked it to 31 deaths.

Alternatives sought, stock plunges as anti-pain drug recalled

Pharmacists stopped dispensing Vioxx and patients began asking their doctors about alternatives to the popular anti-pain drug after Merck & Co. pulled it from the market because new data found it doubled the risk of heart attacks and strokes.
"We immediately called the nursing units and pulled the medications," said Beverly Grove, assistant administrator at the Rest Haven-York nursing home in York, Pa.
Merck's stock plunged almost 27 percent - wiping out $28 billion of market value - on Thursday as the Whitehouse Station, N.J.-based pharmaceutical giant said the recall will hurt its earnings.
Vioxx is one of Merck's most important drugs, with $1.8 billion in U.S. sales in 2003 and global sales of $2.5 billion - 11 percent of the company's $22.49 billion in revenue that year.
Merck said approximately 2 million people worldwide use Vioxx, which is prescribed for arthritis, acute pain and disorders such as carpal tunnel syndrome.
"I'm going to check with my supplier and my doctor," Mike Adams of Sun City, Ariz., said after learning of the recall. Adams said he takes the drug "only when I have pain" from prostate surgery.
Dr. Kutaiba Tabbaa, director of pain management at University Medical Center in Tucson, Ariz., said switching to Pfizer Inc.'s Celebrex and its successor drug, Bextra, and other alternatives won't be a problem for most patients.
"There are no withdrawal symptoms and there are a lot of other medications available on the market," Tabbaa said.
Dr. Steven Abramson, director of rheumatology at New York University Hospital for Joint Diseases, said "there are very few patients for whom there won't be a good alternative drug."
Besides Celebrex, which Abramson said hasn't been linked to heart complications, alternatives include generic anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen, naproxen and aspirin.
Pharmacists at Holy Spirit Hospital in Camp Hill, Pa., began identifying Vioxx patients immediately after learning of the recall Thursday morning, said pharmacy director Gregory George.
Holy Spirit's medical staff had previously authorized a substitute for Vioxx, George said.
"We are ordering the alternative drug in, we are reviewing the patient's medication profile for any allergies or any potential drug interactions, and then we will automatically convert our patients over to the new drug tomorrow," he said.
However, patients should take the initiative to contact their doctors. Many doctors don't have computer databases that let them quickly determine which of their patients are taking a specific drug, said Dr. Richard Pearis, a Phoenix orthopedic surgeon.
"We would hope that the patients would call us," said Pearis, who specializes in sports medicine and arthroscopy. "We'd tell them to stop taking it and what we'd like them to do."
Pearis said he would switch his patients to another anti-inflammatory drug.
Merck said the clinical trial data showed an increased risk of heart attack and other cardiovascular complications 18 months after patients started taking Vioxx.
The three-year study - aimed at showing that Vioxx could prevent the recurrence of polyps, which can turn cancerous, in the colon and rectum - was stopped after Merck discovered participants had double the risk of a heart attack compared to those taking a placebo. During the study, 10 patients died, five who had been taking Vioxx and five who took dummy pills.
At least one plaintiffs' attorney announced plans for a class-action lawsuit against Merck. Another claimed to represent 58 patients around the country allegedly harmed by Vioxx, including people who suffered a heart attack, stroke, internal bleeding or kidney failure.
Merck spokesman Tony Plohoros said the company anticipates additional personal injury lawsuits over Vioxx may be filed and will defend them vigorously.
Shares in Merck, one of the world's biggest drug makers, plunged $12.07, nearly 27 percent, to close at $33 on the New York Stock Exchange. More than 140 million shares were traded, compared to a daily average below 10 million.
The Vioxx recall stands to benefit Pfizer, the world's biggest drugmaker. Merck and Pfizer have been battling for market share, with Pfizer's Celebrex arthritis drug dominating the market with about $2.6 billion in U.S. sales alone last year. Pfizer shares were up 35 cents to $30.53 in afternoon trading on the NYSE.
Vioxx was labeled with a warning about heart risks in 2002 after Merck's own study in 2000 uncovered the increased risk of heart attack and other complications. The Food and Drug Administration has been monitoring problems reported to it since then.
Tabbaa said he was among physicians who started steering patients away from Vioxx to alternatives because of earlier concerns about Vioxx.
"Two years ago I was using it like crazy," Tabbaa said.
Vioxx's removal will be a blow to hopes that it and other drugs in the class known as COX-2 inhibitors could be used to prevent cancer in people at high risk of developing it. A landmark study in 2002 showed that small, daily doses of aspirin could prevent colon cancer, and studies hinted that COX-2 inhibitors might do the same - possibly without aspirin's side effects.

Health Canada recalls anti-inflammatory drug Prexige because of potential for liver-damage

Health Canada ordered the anti-inflammatory drug Prexige off the market Thursday because of the potential risk of serious liver-related effects.
The department said sales and market authorization of the drug will be stopped for lumiracoxib, which is sold by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Canada Inc. as Prexige.
The drug is not on sale in the U.S. The Food and Drug Administration sent a "non-approvable" letter to Switzerland-based Novartis AG last week for use of lumiracoxib for patients with osteoarthritic pain.
Novartis said Thursday it is in discussions with the FDA and is reviewing the content of the letter.
Prexige treats acute and chronic signs and symptoms of knee osteoarthritis in adults. In July of this year, its approval in Canada was widened to include treatment of general osteoarthritis in adults.
Prexige, which was approved for sale in Canada less than a year ago, has recently been linked to rare but serious liver problems in some users. Two such cases have been reported in Canada.
Australia's Therapeutic Goods Administration removed Prexige from its market in August after eight reports of side-effects involving serious liver problems when people took Prexige in 200 milligram and 400 mg doses daily. Two of the people involved died and two required liver transplants.
Following the Australian decision, Health Canada undertook a review of the drug's safety data. In its statement Thursday, the drug regulator said it had reached the conclusion the risk of serious liver-related adverse events cannot be safely managed at the 100 mg daily dose, which Canada had set as the drug's daily maximum dose.

Prescription drug recalls raise questions about FDA approval process

The government's system for approving drugs is coming under renewed scrutiny after a number of widely used medicines have been linked to deaths or serious illness.
Critics say the Food and Drug Administration moves too quickly and puts the drug industry's interests ahead of patient safety. As evidence they point to seven drugs that have been pulled from the market or severely restricted in the past three years. This week alone the diabetes drug Rezulin and the heartburn drug Propulsid were added to the list.
"The FDA is acting in a reckless way to make sure they are not alienating the industry," said Sidney Wolfe, director of the Public Citizen Health Research Group and frequent critic of the agency.
FDA officials insist their system works, but they stress all the side effects of drugs cannot be known until after a drug is approved, and is taken by tens of thousands of patients. Typically, drugs are only tested on about 3,000 people before getting approved.
"There is no truth to the idea that we are any easier on drug approvals," said Dr. Robert Temple, FDA's associate director for medial policy.
The FDA acknowledges there has been a spate of recalls, but says that when viewed over the course of several years, the percentage of drugs pulled from the market has remained stable.
A spokesman for the drug industry agreed.
Since 1980, there have been 528 medicines approved and only 12 or 2 percent have been recalled because of safety reasons, said the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufactures of America. "The fact that only 2 percent have been withdrawn shows two things: The benefits of marketed drugs outweighs the risks, and the safety system in place is working," said spokesman Jeff Trewhitt.
The FDA accelerated its drug review process during the 1990s after Congress complained it was taking too long to approve life-saving medicines.
In the 1980s it usually took almost three years for the agency to approve a drug. Today, the average approval time is one year. For drugs the FDA deems breakthrough medicines, it knocks the review time down to six months.
The acceleration process was shepherded by then FDA commissioner David Kessler, who now wonders about how far it's gone.
"We have to be mindful that the pendulum has not swung too far," Kessler said Friday.
As drug recalls have made headlines in recent years, Congress has begun to pay closer attention to whether the FDA is doing its job properly.
In January, a study the General Accounting Office, Congress' investigative arm, concluded the FDA lacks the ability to properly track problems with drugs after they hit the market. The office recommended that pharmacists work more closely with doctors in prescribing and monitoring drugs.
Part of the problem might be related to the drug industry's increased use of consumer advertising, which is spurring more sales of newer drugs. Rapid introduction of new drugs means that doctors have less experience with them before they are taken by millions of people.
"We tend to want to see the upside of pharmaceuticals and tend to forget they all have risks, something we see with the drugs that have been withdrawn," Kessler said.
Wolfe said the FDA has been too reluctant to take drugs off the market once it discovers problems. He said the agency is too reliant on adding warning labels to the drugs - a system that can fail if doctors fail to read them.
Warner-Lambert's Rezulin was approved in 1997 after just six months of government review because regulators deemed it a crucial new therapy. But within a year the drug was linked to serious liver problems and deaths. The FDA placed several restrictions on the drug last year, and on Tuesday the agency decided to ban it altogether.
One key factor in the FDA's decision to ban the drug now was the fact that two alternatives were approved last year, Avandia and Actos.
The FDA also tried to use warning labels to when it discovered problems with Johnson & Johnson's Propulsid. It changed the labeling five times since the drug was approved in 1993 as it learned about new situations when the drug could cause illness or death. On Thursday, with prodding from the FDA, the company said it would stop marketing the drug which had $950 million in sales in 1999 and it would stop distributing it to drug stores in July.
Instead, J&J will make the pill available for a limited basis to certain patients who cannot take alternative medicines.
Shares of J&J on Friday fell $8.75, or 11 percent to $71.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.

Merck Faces Flood Of Vioxx Lawsuits After Drug Recall

The drug manufacturer Merck & Company is facing a flood of litigation after pulling its best-selling pain reliever, Vioxx, off the shelves late last month.
Merck officials say they issued the voluntary recall as soon as company research made it clear that patients who used Vioxx for 18 months or more faced a much higher risk of heart attacks and strokes than those taking placebos.
Attorneys who filed the first of what are expected to be thousands of personal-injury lawsuits charged that the pharmaceutical giant disregarded evidence of Vioxx-related problems dating back to 1999, the year the drug first went on the market.
Given that an estimated 20 million Americans have taken Vioxx over the past five years, and given that heart disease and stroke are common ailments, observers said this could become one of the biggest product-liability cases in history.
Scores of law firms are scrambling to take part, advertising heavily for clients in newspapers and on the Internet. Among them is Weitz & Luxenberg, a Manhattan firm that includes the speaker of the state Assembly, Sheldon Silver, as one of its affiliated attorneys.
"If you've been injured as a result of taking Vioxx for treatment of osteoarthritis, menstrual symptoms, or acute pain, your first call should be to your doctor," the firm said in a recent newspaper ad. "Your second call should be to the law firm of Weitz & Luxenberg."
In a recent statement on the fallout from its recall, Merck said it had been named in 300 lawsuits on behalf of 900 plaintiff groups in the first 15 days after announcing the recall. With its stock price down about 25% since the announcement, the company also expects to be sued by shareholders who lost money. Merck said it could not predict what it will cost to resolve these suits or whether its insurance would be sufficient to cover its liability and legal costs.
"A series of highly unfavorable outcomes could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position, liquidity, and results of operations," the statement said.
The situation illustrates the high stakes world of the pharmaceutical industry, where a drug like Vioxx, which was generating $2.5 billion a year in revenue for Merck, can become a huge liability overnight.
The case also provides a Rorschach test for partisans in the debate over tort reform. Defenders of the civil liability system argue that Merck must be held responsible for aggressively marketing what turned out to be a dangerous medicine, and that trial lawyers will help by vigorously pursuing compensation for the injured parties.
"Fees are the last thing we're thinking about at this point," said one attorney suing Merck, Jeffrey Reiff of Reiff & Bily of Philadelphia.
Critics of the tort system contend that trial lawyers, with their widespread advertising, are likely to file thousands of frivolous cases along with the good ones, and the courts won't necessarily do a good job of sorting them out.
"If someone is really injured be cause of an undisclosed and unknown defect in that product, it's certainly fair for that person to seek compensation from the manufacturer," said the executive director of the group Common Good, Franklin Stone. "The problem is the system isn't fair about distinguishing between those who deserve compensation and those who don't.
"Even when a company has done nothing wrong, the mere expense of having to go through litigation causes companies to want to reduce their risk and not enter a market," Ms. Stone said.
A neurosurgeon and attorney from Long Island, Harvey Wachsman, said he believes both Merck and the U.S. Food & Drug Administration were negligent. When a previous study found that Vioxx patients suffered more heart problems than those taking naproxen, an over-the-counter pain reliever, the company argued that naproxen was preventing heart disease, he said.
"If you put something into the course of commerce, you're responsible for what you're doing," Dr. Wachsman said. 1009 1857 1115 1868"They make billions and billions and there's no protection for the public."
The editor ofOverlawyered.com, Walter Olson, noted that lawsuits charging Vioxx-related health problems didn't turn into a torrent until Merck issued a voluntary recall based on its own study - in effect, punishing the company for doing the right thing.
The recall "should not in itself indicate guilt," Mr. Olson said. "However, it is felt by lawyers involved in drug litigation that a withdrawal will set the jury off thinking there is more of a problem. ... You have a very troublesome incentive for manufacturers. If they do a recall or withdrawal they might be seen as liable."
That heart disease and stroke are common diseases is a mixed blessing for both sides of this litigation, Mr. Olson said. On the one hand, it creates a huge pool of potential plaintiffs for lawsuits. On the other, it makes it harder to prove that the injury was a result of taking Vioxx and not a coincidence.
He said many law firms try to amass as many clients as possible, believing it gives them leverage in settlement negotiations with the manufacturer. Some might be positioning themselves for a claim to lead-plaintiff status if the lawsuits are consolidated into a class action.
When contacted by an employee of The New York Sun inquiring on behalf of a family member who had taken Vioxx, several law firms advertising on the Internet turned away the case when they learned the patient had not suffered signs of heart disease or stroke.
Not all the advertisers were so scrupulous. One Web page, at vioxx.x.yi.org, claimed that a Vioxx lawsuit could result in an "easy $1 million." It encouraged would-be plaintiffs to find places still selling Vioxx and buy some, saying that would give them a case against the manufacturer and the pharmacy. For a fee of $100, the site offered "a document showing how an average person can benefit from this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to become a millionaire."
The operator of the page, who gave his name only as Leon, said he had done nothing wrong.
"I'm not encouraging people to lie," he said. "Eventually the court will decide whether the case is valid or not."

Able Laboratories, maker of about 40 generic drugs, said yesterday that it had suspended manufacturing and is recalling all of its products after a review found testing practices failed to meet federal standards. The news set off a 29.7 percent decline in the company's share price. 
 Able also withdrew applications filed with the Food and Drug Administration for approval to sell seven drugs. The disruption of business will have a ''material adverse effect'' on operations, the company said. 
 The recall followed the company's announcement last week that it had halted all shipments and that its co-founder and chief executive, Dhananjay G. Wadekar, had resigned. The company, based in Cranbury, N.J., also withdrew its revenue forecast at that time and named its president, Robert J. Mauro, as interim chief. 
 The company, with $103.2 million in 2004 sales, makes generic drugs for attention deficit disorder, hypertension, pain, asthma and bacterial infections. Products include acetaminophen and codeine for pain, atenolol for high blood pressure and clorazepate dipotassium for anxiety. 
 Other drugs include the stimulant dextroamphetamine, the antihistamine hydroxyzine, the corticosteroid hydrocortisone acetate, the pain drugs naproxen and indomethacin, the antipsychotic lithium and the asthma drug theophylline. 
 An Able factory in South Plainfield, N.J., last year produced more than 1.3 billion tablets, capsules and suppositories, according to a March 15 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 
 The company said in a May 10 regulatory filing that it was reviewing its compliance with F.D.A. rules.

Merck Faces Flood Of Vioxx Lawsuits After Drug Recall
New York Sun (Archive)
October 27, 2004 Wednesday

The drug manufacturer Merck & Company is facing a flood of litigation after pulling its best-selling pain reliever, Vioxx, off the shelves late last month.
Merck officials say they issued the voluntary recall as soon as company research made it clear that patients who used Vioxx for 18 months or more faced a much higher risk of heart attacks and strokes than those taking placebos.
Attorneys who filed the first of what are expected to be thousands of personal-injury lawsuits charged that the pharmaceutical giant disregarded evidence of Vioxx-related problems dating back to 1999, the year the drug first went on the market.
Given that an estimated 20 million Americans have taken Vioxx over the past five years, and given that heart disease and stroke are common ailments, observers said this could become one of the biggest product-liability cases in history.
Scores of law firms are scrambling to take part, advertising heavily for clients in newspapers and on the Internet. Among them is Weitz & Luxenberg, a Manhattan firm that includes the speaker of the state Assembly, Sheldon Silver, as one of its affiliated attorneys.
"If you've been injured as a result of taking Vioxx for treatment of osteoarthritis, menstrual symptoms, or acute pain, your first call should be to your doctor," the firm said in a recent newspaper ad. "Your second call should be to the law firm of Weitz & Luxenberg."
In a recent statement on the fallout from its recall, Merck said it had been named in 300 lawsuits on behalf of 900 plaintiff groups in the first 15 days after announcing the recall. With its stock price down about 25% since the announcement, the company also expects to be sued by shareholders who lost money. Merck said it could not predict what it will cost to resolve these suits or whether its insurance would be sufficient to cover its liability and legal costs.
"A series of highly unfavorable outcomes could have a material adverse effect on the company's financial position, liquidity, and results of operations," the statement said.
The situation illustrates the high stakes world of the pharmaceutical industry, where a drug like Vioxx, which was generating $2.5 billion a year in revenue for Merck, can become a huge liability overnight.
The case also provides a Rorschach test for partisans in the debate over tort reform. Defenders of the civil liability system argue that Merck must be held responsible for aggressively marketing what turned out to be a dangerous medicine, and that trial lawyers will help by vigorously pursuing compensation for the injured parties.
"Fees are the last thing we're thinking about at this point," said one attorney suing Merck, Jeffrey Reiff of Reiff & Bily of Philadelphia.
Critics of the tort system contend that trial lawyers, with their widespread advertising, are likely to file thousands of frivolous cases along with the good ones, and the courts won't necessarily do a good job of sorting them out.
"If someone is really injured be cause of an undisclosed and unknown defect in that product, it's certainly fair for that person to seek compensation from the manufacturer," said the executive director of the group Common Good, Franklin Stone. "The problem is the system isn't fair about distinguishing between those who deserve compensation and those who don't.
"Even when a company has done nothing wrong, the mere expense of having to go through litigation causes companies to want to reduce their risk and not enter a market," Ms. Stone said.

Biogen Idec, Elan Take Body Blows on Sudden Drug Recall

Shareholders of both Biogen Idec and Elan suffered a sharp blow yesterday as both stocks plunged on news that Tysabari, a multiple sclerosis drug that was seen as a potential huge revenue generator, was pulled from the market after the companies disclosed that a patient died after taking Tysabari in conjunction with another drug.
Moreover, another patient on the drug has apparently developed a rare and frequently fatal nervous system disease. It is the first biotech drug to be removed from the market.
The shares of Cambridge, Mass.-based Biogen Idec dropped to $38.65 from $67.28, a decline of $28.63. The company's previous 52-week low had been $50. 87. Dublin, Ireland-based Elan skidded to $8.00 from $26.90, a drop of 70.26%.
Tysabari, which was jointly marketed by the companies, had received Food and Drug Administration approval for release in November. In a two-year trial that was only partially completed, the initial results were considered promising, with reported incidents of worsening neurological functioning in relapsing-remitting MS sufferers dropping nearly 67%. The results of the clinical trials - involving 942 patients in 99 different clinics - will be released in April.
A Deutsche Bank analyst, Jennifer Chao, described the drug as having been "next to the holy grail," according to Bloomberg. She then called yesterday's news "one of the biggest disappointments in biotech of the decade." She placed a "sell" rating on the company's stock, still a relatively rare occurrence at firms that have full-scale investment banking divisions.
In a conference call announcing Tysabari's suspension, the chief executive officer of Elan, Kelly Martin, said that if a detailed review of the drug proves that this was an isolated incident, they hope to have it back in the pipeline by "late summer or fall." However, his timeline is reliant upon the FDA approving its re-release. The companies did not provide revenues to date, nor would they discuss potential layoffs. Biogen Idec's CEO Jim Mullen did note, however, that the company had hired about 450 people to help with all phases of the drug's launch.
Wall Street's equity analysts reacted swiftly, with four different firms lowering their ratings on the companies. Morningstar, which does not maintain any banking or advisory relationships with the companies it follows, said the withdrawal would hit Elan especially hard. "The firm's pipeline, aside from Tysabari, is relatively weak," it wrote.
Another consideration in the fallout is the loss of potential sales from other applications for Tysabari, including Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis. The companies were in stage II trials for rheumatoid arthritis and had applied to the European Union for trials to begin testing on Crohn's.

FDA doing a 'spectacular job' despite drug recalls

The federal drug safety agency is doing a "spectacular job" of protecting the public, the White House chief of staff said last month. The assessment drew an immediate outcry from a Senate critic who charged that government oversight under the Bush administration has proved ''a catastrophic failure.''
The debate about the effectiveness of the Food and Drug Administration came days after the agency began advising doctors to consider alternatives to Celebrex, the leading arthritis painkiller, for their patients. A study had shown that the Pfizer medication increased the risk of heart attack and stroke when taken at high doses.
In December 2004, Pfizer said it would leave Celebrex on the market, although the same problems led Merck & Co. in September 2004 to withdraw from the market its painkiller Vioxx, a Celebrex competitor.
"For millions of patients, Celebrex is the best option, or, in some cases, the last option, to live a normal life with the pain and inflammation of arthritis," Hank McKinnell, Pfizer's chairman and chief executive officer, said.
Pfizer later said it would stop advertising Celebrex to consumers. The move covers TV, radio, newspaper and magazine advertising.
The FDA's acting commissioner, Lester Crawford, said the agency has "great concern" about Celebrex and a group of similar medications, called COX-2 inhibitors.
The National Institutes of Health, which halted a study testing Celebrex for cancer prevention, ordered a full review of studies involving COX-2 drugs.
President Bush's chief of staff, Andrew Card, said, "I don't know that we need a commission. I would like the FDA to continue to do the job they do."
Appearing on ABC's "This Week," Card said, "I support the FDA. They do a spectacular job. When you think about all of the new technologies and the new drugs that are coming into the marketplace, and they have to review them all to make sure that when they come into the marketplace, they live up to the expectation of improving healthcare."
That the public is learning about drugs on the markets that "may not live up to those expectations is a testament to the FDA in how they do their job," Card said.
But the top Democrat on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee charged that the administration's record "on protecting us from harmful prescription drugs is a catastrophic failure."
Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) said in a statement: "We need an FDA that looks out for the health of patients and not just the health of the pharmaceutical industry. Lives are at stake, and the president should put an FDA leadership team in place right away, with no ties to the industry it regulates, and that's committed to reform."
An internal FDA survey made public last month found that about two-thirds of agency scientists are less than fully confident in the FDA's monitoring of the safety of prescription drugs now being sold. Also, more than one-third of those scientists had some doubts about the process for approving new drugs.
The chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Republican Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, has suggested that an independent board of drug safety may be needed to ensure the safety of medications after FDA approval.

U.S. drug manfacturer recalls millions of acetaminophen pills

A major U.S. manufacturer of store-brand acetaminophen recalled 11 million bottles of the pain-relieving pills Thursday after discovering some were contaminated with metal fragments.
There were no immediate reports of injuries or illness.
Perrigo Co. said it discovered the metal bits during quality-control checks.
The recall affects bottles containing various amounts of 500-milligram caplets.
Perrigo bills itself as the world's largest manufacturer of store-brand nonprescription drugs. The company did not disclose the chains for which it manufactures the store-brand acetaminophen.
However, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., CVS Corp., Walgreen Co. and Costco Wholesale Corp. are among the companies it supplies with health care products, according to company financial statements.
It was not immediately known if Perrigo has international customers.
Perrigo said the pills contained raw material purchased from a third-party supplier and affected 383 batches.
Acetaminophen is best known as the drug in products sold under the Tylenol brand, but is widely available in generic versions. The recall does not affect Tylenol. The recall should not cause a shortage of acetaminophen, the Food and Drug Administration said.
The voluntary recall is considered a Class II recall since it covers products that might cause a temporary health problem or pose only a slight threat of a serious nature, according to the FDA.

Buying Prescriptions Online Could Save Your Life; drugstore.com-TM- Announces Launch of the eMedAlert Program to Notify Customers of Drug Recalls

Peter Neupert, chief executive officer of drugstore.com(TM), the nation's leading online pharmacy, announced today that drugstore.com will launch a formal program to provide customers with notification "in Internet time" of major prescription drug warnings and recalls. Speaking at the International Conference on Internet and Society at Harvard University, Neupert told a group of Internet and technology executives that the eMedAlert program "is another example of how the Internet enhances the relationship between businesses and their customers and provides unprecedented new benefits for consumers."
According to Neupert, drugstore.com's eMedAlert program will alert customers when a prescription drug previously received from its pharmacy has been withdrawn or recalled by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or a pharmaceutical manufacturer, or when crucial new safety information is available about the product.
"There's no doubt that drugstore.com's eMedAlert program has the potential to save lives," said Carmen A. Catizone, MS, R.Ph, Executive Director/Secretary of the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP) and its Verified Internet Pharmacy Practice Sites (VIPPS) Program. "This is a great example of how the Internet can rapidly deliver the right information to the right people. We applaud drugstore.com for the company's innovation and its demonstration of concern for the customer."
The first-of-its-kind program combines the expertise of drugstore.com's pharmacists with the personalization technology of the Internet enabling unique, individualized and highly relevant, and targeted electronic information delivery to customers.
This rapid notification capability is especially important in the healthcare industry, since well over 90 percent of patient medical records are available only in paper form, making it virtually impossible for most physicians and pharmacists to identify and quickly communicate important drug recall and warning information to specific patients.
"We've seen great progress in the last 50 years of drug development," said Andy Stergachis, drugstore.com's chief pharmacist. "But despite rigorous clinical trials and testing procedures, no new drug is absolutely safe: there is always some risk of adverse reaction. As a result, there is always a pressing need to notify patients as soon as important new risks become apparent. It was clear to us that the Internet offered an unprecedented opportunity to communicate vital, must-have drug recall and warning information to our patients. The eMedAlert program brings patient care at drugstore.com to a whole new level."
Neupert said that the eMedAlert program was the result of drugstore.com's experience in three recent situations involving drug recalls or warnings from the FDA and the drug manufacturers. Concerned about the threat these drugs posed to their customers, drugstore.com pharmacists used the technology at their fingertips to respond quickly. On an informal basis, they were able to communicate rapidly and directly to specific customers the relevant warnings. The informal efforts proved extremely successful. "It was exciting to realize that we have the opportunity to offer our prescription customers a possibly life-saving benefit," said Neupert. "The eMedAlert program will not only provide this important information in 'Internet time,' but also in a manner that respects and protects the privacy and security of our customers' personal medical information."
The eMedAlert program works as follows: Clinical pharmacists at drugstore.com continuously monitor reports of drug and product recalls and withdrawals, using several sources -- the FDA Web site, as well as the receipt of warnings directly from drug manufacturers and drug wholesalers. Once aware of the problem, drugstore.com pharmacists quickly determine if any customers are affected. Next, they send a targeted e-mail alert urging customers to log on to the drugstore.com Web site for specific information regarding their prescription (note that all detailed information, such as drug name or specific patient information, is not included in the e-mail, in order to protect patient confidentiality). Customers log on to the drugstore.com Web site with password access, in order to learn the details of the recall, including the drug name and patient-specific recall instructions and communications. In addition, drugstore.com pharmacists will also post general information about the recall/warning on the Web site, so that new or potential customers, in searching or browsing the Web site, may also learn the news. drugstore.com expects to launch the eMedAlert program early in the third quarter. Additional details about the eMedAlert program can be found on the drugstore.com Web site, at www.drugstore.com.

Drug approval under scrutiny;  A series of drug recalls spurs critics to claim the FDA moves too quickly and puts the industry ahead of patient safety.

CITY EDITION

The government's system for approving drugs has come under renewed scrutiny after a number of widely used medicines have been linked to deaths or serious illness.
Critics say the Food and Drug Administration moves too quickly and puts the drug industry's interests ahead of patient safety. As evidence they point to seven drugs that have been pulled from the market or severely restricted in the past three years. This week alone, the diabetes drug Rezulin and the heartburn drug Propulsid were added to the list.
"The FDA is acting in a reckless way to make sure they are not alienating the industry," said Sidney Wolfe, director of the Public Citizen Health Research Group and a frequent critic of the agency.
FDA officials insist their system works, but they stress all the side effects of drugs cannot be known until after a drug is approved and is taken by tens of thousands of patients. Typically, drugs are only tested on about 3,000 people before getting approved.
"There is no truth to the idea that we are any easier on drug approvals," said Dr. Robert Temple, FDA's associate director for medical policy.
The FDA acknowledges there has been a spate of recalls, but says that when viewed over the course of several years, the percentage of drugs pulled from the market has remained stable.
A spokesman for the drug industry agreed.
Since 1980, there have been 528 medicines approved and only 12, or 2 percent, have been recalled because of safety reasons, said the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America.
"The fact that only 2 percent have been withdrawn shows two things: The benefits of marketed drugs outweighs the risks, and the safety system in place is working," said spokesman Jeff Trewhitt.
The FDA accelerated its drug review process during the 1990s after Congress complained it was taking too long to approve lifesaving medicines.
In the 1980s it usually took almost three years for the agency to approve a drug. Today, the average approval time is one year. For drugs the FDA deems breakthrough medicines, it knocks the review time down to six months.
The acceleration process was shepherded by then-FDA commissioner David Kessler, who now wonders about how far it's gone.
"We have to be mindful that the pendulum has not swung too far," Kessler said Friday.
As drug recalls have made headlines in recent years, Congress has begun to pay closer attention to whether the FDA is doing its job properly.
In January, the General Accounting Office, Congress' investigative arm, concluded the FDA lacks the ability to properly track problems with drugs after they hit the market. The office recommended that pharmacists work more closely with doctors in prescribing and monitoring drugs.
Part of the problem might be related to the drug industry's increased use of consumer advertising, which is spurring more sales of newer drugs. Rapid introduction of new drugs means that doctors have less experience with them before they are taken by millions of people.
"We tend to want to see the upside of pharmaceuticals and tend to forget they all have risks, something we see with the drugs that have been withdrawn," Kessler said.
Wolfe said the FDA has been too reluctant to take drugs off the market once it discovers problems. He said the agency is too reliant on adding warning labels to the drugs -- a system that can fail if doctors fail to read them.
Warner-Lambert's Rezulin was approved in 1997 after just six months of government review because regulators deemed it a crucial new therapy. But within a year the drug was linked to serious liver problems and deaths. The FDA placed several restrictions on the drug last year, and on Tuesday the agency decided to ban it altogether.
One key factor in the FDA's decision to ban the drug now was the fact that two alternatives were approved last year, Avandia and Actos.
The FDA also tried to use warning labels to when it discovered problems with Johnson & Johnson's Propulsid. It changed the labeling five times since the drug was approved in 1993 as it learned about new situations when the drug could cause illness or death.

Anti-rejection drug, toaster ovens recalled

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration Tuesday announced the nationwide recall of the oral solution of a generic anti-rejection drug because of evidence its effectiveness is reduced if administered with apple juice.
And the Consumer Product Safety Commission announced the recall of 7,000 toaster ovens because of possible fire hazard.
The FDA recall involved SangCya oral solution, the generic form of cyclosporine (Neoral oral solution). Patients taking cyclosporine capsules are not affected.
The FDA said it was recently informed by SangStat Medical Corp. of Fremont, Calif., that clinical data shows taking SangCya with apple juice diminishes its absorption relative to Neoral. Because the labeling indicates the drug can be taken with either apple or orange juice, FDA sought the recall.
SangCya will remain available through pharmacies and hospitals to allow for a smooth transition to another cyclosporine product.
The CPSC said the heating elements of Welbilt toaster ovens can break, causing the glass doors on the appliances to shatter or producing electric shocks and fires.
Appliance Co. of America of Great Neck, N.Y., received 14 reports of incidents, including a report of a countertop being scorched. No injuries were reported.
The affected toaster ovens came with rotisserie and griddle and carry the model No. TR660. They were sold at club, discount and department stores and through mail order catalogs between January and May for about $100.
Consumers are advised to stop using the ovens immediately and call 800-872-1656 for free replacement.

11 million bottles of pain drug recalled; Acetaminophen pills could have metal bits

Approximately 11 million bottles of 500-milligram acetaminophen caplets, sold as various drugstore and supermarket brands across the country, are being recalled because the manufacturer found tiny metal fragments in a small number of the pills, the Food and Drug Administration announced Thursday.
"To date, we have not received any reports of either injury or illness related to the product," Douglas Throckmorton, deputy director for the FDA center that regulates drugs, said at a press conference.
The biggest concern is bleeding if the fragments -- which the FDA says range from "microdots" to a third of an inch of wire -- come in contact with the digestive tract, Throckmorton said, adding that the likelihood of that is "remote."
Throckmorton said the recall, conducted voluntarily by the Perrigo Company of Allegan, Mich., is not expected to cause a shortage of acetaminophen, a pain reliever.
A list of affected store brands, which include CVS and Safeway, can be found at www.fda.gov/oc/po/firmrecalls/perrigo/perrigocustlist.html. A list of the 383 affected lots, whose expiration dates range from this past September to August 2009, can be found at            www.fda.gov/oc/po/firmrecalls/perrigo/perrigobatchlist.html.
Fred Richman, head of compliance in the FDA's enforcement office, said Perrigo, which describes itself as the world's largest maker of store brand, over-the-counter drug and nutritional products, notified the agency of the problem Nov.1.
The FDA said Perrigo reported that some manufacturing equipment was wearing down prematurely, but Richman said it's not yet known whether that caused the contamination. Perrigo's spokesman did not return phone calls.
The FDA says people who think they have some of the recalled acetaminophen should stop using it and call Perrigo's consumer affairs department at 877-546-0454.
Perrigo stock closed Thursday at $17, down $1.01.

U.S. drug manufacturer recalls millions of acetaminophen pills

A major U.S. manufacturer of store-brand acetaminophen recalled 11 million bottles of the pain-relieving pills Thursday after discovering some were contaminated with metal fragments.
There were no immediate reports of injuries or illness.
Perrigo Co. said it discovered the metal bits during quality-control checks. The company passed 70 million pills through a metal detector and discovered the metal in about 200 caplets, according to the Food and Drug Administration. The fragments ranged in size from "microdots" to portions of wire one-third of an inch (.846 centimeters) long.
The recall affects bottles containing various amounts of 500-milligram caplets.
Perrigo bills itself as the world's largest manufacturer of store-brand nonprescription drugs. The company did not disclose the chains for which it manufactures the store-brand acetaminophen. A list of batch numbers and store brands affected by the recall was forthcoming, the FDA said.
Wal-Mart Stores Inc., CVS Corp., Walgreen Co. and Costco Wholesale Corp. are among the companies Perrigo supplies with health care products, according to company financial statements.
It was not immediately known if Perrigo has international customers.
Perrigo said the pills contained raw material purchased from a third-party supplier and affected 383 batches.
Acetaminophen is best known as the drug in products sold under the Tylenol brand, but is widely available in generic versions. The recall does not affect Tylenol. The recall should not cause a shortage of acetaminophen, the FDA said.
The voluntary recall is considered a Class II recall since it covers products that might cause a temporary health problem or pose only a slight threat of a serious nature, according to the FDA.
Consumers who swallow any of the contaminated pills could suffer minor stomach discomfort or possible cuts to the mouth and throat, the FDA said, adding that the risk of serious injury was remote. Anyone who suspects they have been injured should contact their doctor, the agency said.
The FDA said Perrigo began investigating after realizing the equipment it uses to make pills was wearing down prematurely.

Wyeth's 'fen-phen' fallout; The recalled diet drug's maker surprised markets with a loss of $1.76 billion in the 4th quarter, sending its stock down 7.8%.

Wyeth, maker of the recalled diet-drug combination called "fen-phen," shocked Wall Street yesterday with a $1.76 billion fourth-quarter loss, sending its stock price lower on reports of higher-than-expected litigation and development costs.
Wyeth, the Madison, N.J., firm with pharmaceutical headquarters in Montgomery County, had seen its stock rise in the last six months as it seemed to contain damage from its 1997 recall of Redux and Pondimin, a combination known as fen-phen.
But Wall Street punished Wyeth after its earnings report yesterday, sending the price down $3.35 a share to $39.63 from Friday's close of $42.98. The 7.8 percent decline was Wyeth's biggest one-day drop since January 2002.
Wyeth lost $1.76 billion, or $1.32 a share, in the fourth quarter, compared with a profit of $335.3 million, or 25 cents a share, for the same quarter in 2003. For the full year, profit was down 40 percent at $1.23 billion, or 91 cents a share, from $2.05 billion, or $1.54 a share, the year before.
Fourth-quarter revenue growth of 7 percent, to $4.65 billion from $4.33 billion, also fell short of analysts' estimates. Full-year revenue rose 9.5 percent to $17.36 billion, from $15.85 billion a year earlier.
Wyeth also disappointed analysts on its projected 2005 earnings growth of 3 percent to 7 percent. "The projection essentially broke our thesis of good growth in 2005," Tim Anderson of Prudential Financial Services said in a note to investors explaining his downgrade from "overweight" to "neutral."
Wyeth "will likely be a very low-growth (or no-growth?) company over the next several years, on average," Anderson wrote.
The company, which already has put $16.6 billion in its fen-phen reserve, said it set aside an additional $4.5 billion in the fourth quarter, and warned of more charges to come. As of Dec. 31, it had paid out $13.9 billion.
"It is possible that additional reserves may be required, and that the additional reserves may be significant," Kenneth Martin, Wyeth's chief financial officer, said in a conference call with analysts.
61,000 cases unresolved
The company said that as many as 61,000 fen-phen cases have yet to be resolved out of more than 70,000 filed so far.
In a double-edged sword, the company reported that it would file six new-drug applications in 2005 and 2006, but to do so would necessitate huge increases in research and development spending. Wyeth spent $145 million more than expected on research in the fourth quarter, and plans a $350 million increase this year, raising R&D expenses 15 percent, to $2.7 billion.
"New products is what drives pharmaceutical companies now," chief executive officer Robert Essner told analysts. "So we made the decision to make whatever investment it takes to bring these products over the goal line."
Last week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted priority review for Wyeth's Tygacil, a new type of antibiotic to treat intra-abdominal infections as well as certain staphylococcus infections. If approved by the FDA, Tygacil could be launched this year.
2 new products a year
Bernard J. Poussot, head of the pharmaceutical division in Upper Providence, said Wyeth was "on target" in setting up a process to deliver on two "innovative products" a year.
Several of Wyeth's key products posted strong sales gains. Sales of its top-selling drug, the antidepressant Effexor, rose 23 percent worldwide, to $3.3 billion. That beat the company's estimate.
However, Effexor sales fell short of analysts' projections. The company also warned that sales could "moderate" across the antidepressant market in the future because of decisions by U.S. and British regulators to require stricter labeling and instructions on the risks.
"Although Wyeth is complying, we are challenging" the regulatory decisions, Poussot said. "With the data we submit to the FDA, we think the labeling is fine."
Sales for Wyeth's arthritis drug Enbrel rose 46 percent to $1.9 billion in North America, where it is marketed by Amgen Inc. Outside North America, Enbrel sales for the year more than doubled to $680 million.
Sales for Prevnar, a vaccine to prevent invasive pneumococcal disease in infants and young children, rose 62 percent in the fourth quarter, to $340 million, and 11 percent for the year, to $1.1 billion.

Drug pullout Massive recall of Vioxx poses logistical problems.

Theodore Fields was in a meeting discussing the latest medical journal articles one morning last month when someone came in with a printout announcing that Merck was voluntarily pulling its blockbuster drug Vioxx from the market. Concerns that had been plaguing the widely prescribed anti-inflammatory drug for about two years-that it increased the risk of heart attack and stroke-were soundly confirmed by a study being conducted on patients at risk for developing colon polyps. Merck stopped the study early for safety reasons.
After the meeting, Fields, director of the rheumatology faculty practice plan at the 138-bed Hospital for Special Surgery in New York, marched to his office and had his secretary call every patient whom he had prescribed the drug to in the last couple of years. He said he does not know how many that was, but it was a four- or five-day process to reach everyone. Some patients called him before he could call them.
"The immediatereactions were a broad spectrum, everything from 'I have another two weeks, can I take it?' to 'Oh my God, I just took one this morning. What should I do?' '' Fields said.
Launched in the U.S. in 1999, Vioxx posted worldwide sales of $2.5 billion in 2003. Its sudden removal from the antipain medication arsenal was perhaps economically devastating only for Merck, which has promised to make good on unused pills, but it tested the healthcare system's ability to respond quickly to the largest prescription drug recall in U.S. history.
"It wasn't an easy proposition, but it didn't seem right to just count on the people who called us,'' Fields said.
With 41 rheumatologists on staff at the orthopedic specialty hospital, Vioxx was a prominent antipain remedy that was first introduced to many inpatients at HSS. Even before the recall, the hospital's Web site posted an article by Michael Lockshin, an attending rheumatologist, expressing his opinion that data from a 2001 study suggesting an increased cardiovascular risk from using Vioxx was inconclusive. Fields said he probably more frequently prescribed other drugs in the same class of COX-2 inhibitors as Vioxx, but it was because of patients' concerns about the cardiovascular risk, not his.
Now that those concerns are validated, "it's made a lot of patients anxious beyond the issue of Vioxx,'' he said. In the prior week, two different patients called because they said they had heard that two different drugs completely unrelated to Vioxx had been recalled, which was not true. "I think there has been an element of hysteria and false rumor,'' Fields said.
Last week in a conference call, Merck defended its handling of the recall, insisting that evidence of increased risk of heart attack and stroke had not been confirmed until after 18 months of treatment of Vioxx. The company will present data from the aborted study at a meeting of the American College of Rheumatology in San Antonio on Oct. 18. Merck officials did not respond to requests for an interview.
The recall tested the mettle of the 999-bed Cleveland (Ohio) Clinic's electronic medical record system. James Young, chairman of the division of medicine, said the information system is integrated into 12 regional healthcare centers. When the recall was announced, the system was queried as to which patients in the outpatient clinics were taking Vioxx on a chronic basis. The system spit out 11,000 names. The hospital sent letters to each of them, notifying them of Merck's recall, discussing the issues "in a non-inflammatory way,'' and recommending that they stop taking the drug and contact the doctor who had prescribed the medicine, Young said. The hospital also contacted the physicians of those 11,000 patients-many of whom were likely not the prescribing physicians-to let them know that their patients had been taking the recalled drug.
Young said he had little concern that the recall would raise the price of alternative drugs. A more important question is whether the problem with Vioxx is a problem just for Vioxx or for the entire class of COX-2 inhibitors, which are designed to minimize the gastrointestinal side effects of more traditional pain relievers and anti-inflammatories known as NSAIDS or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The two alternatives in the COX-2 class are Celebrex and Bextra, which are both made by Pfizer.
Many patients were first introduced to Vioxx in hospitals because of Merck's heavy promotion to hospitals and doctors' offices. Merck offered Vioxx to most group purchasing organizations at more than 90% off the wholesale price, said William Larkin, senior vice president of pharmacy at GNYHA Ventures, the for-profit subsidiary of the Greater New York Hospital Association. Such nominal pricing policies are employed by many drug companies as a way to get physicians in the habit of prescribing drugs, he said. Pfizer, however, does not discount the acute-care market, so hospitals will now be purchasing the alternatives at roughly greater than 10 times the price they paid for Vioxx, Larkin said. The impact on the 1,500 hospitals that purchase under Premier contracts will be approximately $4 million, according to Larkin.
But even with the nominal discounting program, Vioxx had less than a 50% share of COX-2 inhibitors sold under Novation's group purchasing contracts, said Michael Giboney, senior product manager for Novation. For the last 12 months, Novation hospitals spent $13 million on Vioxx, ranking it 140th on the top selling list of drugs sold $16 million on Celebrex, 114th on the list and $7.2 million on Bextra, ranking it at 231th. In total, Novation hospitals purchase approximately $9 billion in pharmacy products under Novation contracts.
"You have to remember also that while it will cause a steep price increase for hospitals that want to stay with the COX-2 class, hospitals don't generally spend a lot on these types of drugs because they are generally outpatient drugs,'' Larkin said. "Vioxx vs. Celebrex is not going to break the bank.''
As of July, Celebrex outsold Vioxx in the U.S. with a 47.3% market share compared with 31.8% for Vioxx, according to IMS Health, a pharmaceutical information and consulting company. But Vioxx ranked fifth of all drugs promoted to professionals in 2003 with Merck spending $422 million to market it to doctors' offices and hospitals, also according to IMS Health.

Germany's Bayer completes drug recall raising questions on European patient protection

Germany's Bayer AG completed the global recall of its troubled anti-cholesterol drug Thursday, pulling it from the Japanese market, just as a spat between the company and regulators raised questions about protection for patients in Europe.
The Leverkusen-based company said the latest move would reduce its 2001 operating profit by up to 150 million euros (dlrs 137 million). The recall of Baycol, Bayer's No. 3 selling drug, in the rest of the world already was expected to depress earnings for years.
Marketed as Lipobay in many parts of the world, the drug was pulled everywhere except Japan on Aug. 8 after it was linked to 52 deaths. The company faces a raft of lawsuits in the United States and Europe seeking damages on behalf of patients.
Bayer insists the claims are "groundless" and that it worked closely with regulators on both sides of the Atlantic. But the recall has cast a harsh light on the European Union's complex, overlapping system for licensing drugs and monitoring their safety.
Bayer voluntarily pulled the product after increasing reports of side effects of muscular weakness, or rhabdomyolysis, especially in patients being simultaneously treated with another drug called gemfibrozil.
Suspected cases of rhabdomyolysis, which can lead to kidney failure, have been detected in more than 1,100 patients treated with Baycol worldwide, Bayer said Thursday, while emphasizing that no causal link has been established.
Product information has long warned against taking Baycol and gemfibrozil concurrently, and Bayer stiffened the wording in the United States in 1999 after reports of side effects showed doctors there were prescribing some patients with both.
The same precaution was taken in the EU in June after Bayer submitted a new report to the British regulator who first licensed Baycol in 1997. Licenses issued for one EU country generally are adopted by the others.
But in the absence of any EU-wide equivalent to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, national authorities also are responsible for drug safety.
German Health Minister Ulla Schmidt repeated Thursday a complaint that Bayer sent German authorities the data behind the British decision only after the withdrawal was announced, despite rules stating that such findings be passed on within 15 days.
Bayer's information policy in the matter was "totally unacceptable," Schmidt's deputy, Klaus Theo Schroeder, said last week.
The lapse highlighted the need for tighter national and international laws to detect risks earlier, Schroeder said, though officials have stopped short of saying Germany would have tried to pull the drug earlier.
The company, on the other hand, insists "all substantial information" was in the hands of the German regulator in April and that Britain's Medicines Control Agency should have informed its counterparts across the continent.
"There are varying legal interpretations of how the information should be handled," Bayer spokesman Michael Diehl said. "In our view, the British were responsible for informing the others."
The MCA said it informed other regulators immediately about its June decision that a stiffer warning would suffice to protect patients. But it added in a statement that Bayer was required to tell the national authorities about any new information which "may influence the overall balance of the risks and benefits associated with that medicine."
Bayer's shares have dropped by about a quarter since it first announced the withdrawal. The company has pledged to slash thousands of jobs, cut costs and overhaul its pharmaceuticals strategy. Many analysts expect its drug unit to be folded into a joint venture with a rival or sold.
Bayer originally didn't withdraw the drug from the Japanese market since gemfibrozil isn't available there. But Bayer said Thursday it had been informed by the Japanese health authorities that gemfibrozil would soon be registered in Japan.
Bayer also cited the possibility that Japanese users of Baycol could travel abroad and come into contact with gemfibrozil. No deaths in Japan have been linked to the drug.
Last week, it said it would put off its debut on the New York Stock Exchange, set for Sept. 26, until early February.
On Thursday, the shares slipped again, losing 2 percent at 34.20 euros (dlrs 31.22) by late afternoon in Frankfurt.

Concern over medication; Morning sickness prevention drug recalls Thalidomide scare

An international group of doctors says morning sickness should be treated with drugs to prevent the unborn baby's health being endangered by regular vomiting or dehydration in the mother.
Last week, more than 300 doctors in Washington voted for the widespread introduction of a drug called Diclectin, which prevents nausea and vomiting in pregnancy (NVP) and allows mothers to lead a "normal daily life" from the beginning of the pregnancy.
The International Federation of Gynaecologists and Obstetricians (FIGO) conference was told Diclectin has become "the drug of choice" for all pregnant women in Canada and has been used to treat 33 million women in the past 25 years.
The Independent; London
It has undergone full clinical trials and has shown no side-effects for the unborn child. It is used for all morning sickness from mild to severe and is about to be approved for use in the United States.
At the FIGO conference, British doctors called for it to be approved as soon as possible for use in Britain. Around two-thirds of women in Britain suffer morning sickness, usually beginning in the fourth week and lasting two months.
Around 8.6 million work days are lost each year because of it.
There has been much reluctance to give any medication to pregnant mothers following the terrible consequences of the widespread use of Thalidomide in the Sixties when hundreds of children were born with physical defects.
But in around 3 per cent of cases morning sickness is so extreme that women are unable to feed their growing babies because they cannot eat properly and suffer from weight loss and severe dehydration.
They are hospitalized periodically, mainly to prevent dehydration and ensure they get enough nutrients. Research has shown a tiny minority of women, around 50 a year, have morning sickness so badly they seriously consider ending their pregnancy.
Dr. Roger Gadsby, from Nuneaton, and an expert on morning sickness, has been campaigning for Diclectin, which contains two antihistamines and vitamin B6, to be introduced in Britain.
He said the medical profession is paranoid because of Thalidomide and there is a fear of giving any pregnant women any medication during the first three months.
"Diclectin certainly has a good safety record," he said. "The trial evidence shows that it is both safe and effective in treating NVP. It should be available here, there is no need for these women to be suffering."

Janssen Pharmaceutica Products is recalling about 440,000 of its 75 mcg-per-hour prescription DURAGESIC patches, which are used to treat moderate to severe chronic pain.
The company said Monday that less than 19,000, or under 5 percent of the 440,000 patches from manufacturing lot with the control number 0327192, may leak medication along one edge.
No other lots or dosage strengths are affected.
If the medication leaks from the patch, patients can get either too much or too little medication. Exposure to too much medication can occur if the medicine leaks directly onto the skin and the body absorbs a higher than intended amount.
This overexposure may cause nausea, sedation, drowsiness, or potentially life-threatening complications. If the medication leaks out, there may not be enough to provide adequate pain control and the patient may experience withdrawal symptoms. These include sweating, sleeplessness and abdominal discomfort.
Health care professionals, caregivers, or anyone who comes in contact with an affected patch from this lot also may be at risk, the company said. Anyone who comes in contact with the leaked medication should thoroughly rinse exposed skin with water only; do not use soap.
Those who have patches from the affected lot should contact their physician or pharmacist for specific instructions, and to coordinate returning affected patches and obtaining a new supply.
Patients wearing DURAGESIC patches that are not from the affected lot can continue to wear them. Sudden discontinuation of DURAGESIC can cause health problems.
DURAGESIC is a prescription transdermal opioid medication indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic pain.
The affected lot was shipped to distributors in the United States between mid-December 2003 and early January 2004.

EU drug regulator recalls Roche's Viracept due to contamination fears

Europe's drug regulating body on Wednesday recalled an HIV treatment made by Roche Holding AG because of contamination.
"Contamination has been identified at the manufacturing stage ... the steps taken to recall Viracept go down to the level of the individual patient," said Michael Harvey, a spokesman for the European Medicines Agency.
Patients taking Viracept an antiretroviral agent for use in HIV therapy should return the treatment to their physician and request a replacement therapy, Harvey said.
The recall does not affect the use of Viracept in the U.S., where Pfizer Inc. sells the drug, or Canada and Japan, Roche said.
The Swiss pharmaceutical company conducted a chemical analysis on the drug after six patients reported that their batches of Viracept emitted strange odors.
"A detailed chemical analysis of the affected tablets showed they contain higher than normal levels of methane sulfonic acid ethylester," the company said.
Roche said in a statement that it is recalling all batches of Viracept in cooperation with the European watchdog and Swissmedic, Switzerland's drug regulator, in Europe and in some undisclosed countries.
Roche said the financial impact of the recall is negligible.
"The financial impact of this recall isn't material to the company," said Daniel Piller, a spokesman for Basel-based Roche.
Before the recall was disclosed, Roche shares closed down 0.9 percent, or 1.90 Swiss francs lower ($1.55), at 220.70 francs ($180.82), giving the company a market capitalization of over $161 billion.

PHARMACEUTICAL MANUFACTURERS EXPAND MASSIVE DRUG RECALL KV PHARMACEUTICAL FACES CLASS-ACTION LAWSUITS, SEC INQUIRY

The following information was released by the American Academy of Family Physicians:
KV Pharmaceutical Co. and its subsidiaries have expanded a recall initiated late last year to include a total of more than 90 drug products. The products were recalled for failing to comply with current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations established by the FDA.
KV subsidiary Ethex Corp. said in a Jan. 28 news release that patients who have these medications "should continue to take them in accordance with their prescriptions, as the risk of suddenly stopping needed medication may place patients at risk."
Furthermore, the company said that patients should contact their physicians "if they have experienced any problems that may be related to taking or using these products or to obtain replacement medications or prescriptions."
Background
Ethex recalled 5-mg tablets of dextroamphetamine sulfate in October 2008 because of the possible presence of oversized tablets. The company said in a news release at the time that the oversized tablets may contain twice the labeled amount of the active ingredient.
In December, the company recalled 2-mg tablets of hydromorphone hydrochloride because of the possible presence of oversized tablets.
KV Pharmaceutical said at that time it would voluntarily suspend shipments of all FDA-approved drug products in tablet form as a precautionary measure. The company also said that it planned to "expeditiously address manufacturing issues."
Fast Forward
On Jan. 26, KV announced that it had voluntarily suspended the manufacturing and shipping of all of its products, with the exception of some products that it distributes but does not manufacture. KV said it is cooperating with an FDA inspection of the company's operations and inventory.
Ethex had recalled more than 60 products at the wholesale level and seven at the retail level in late January, but the company added to its list of products recalled at the retail level in early February.
On Feb. 3, Ethex recalled more than 20 versions of the company's prescription prenatal vitamins, as well as four prescription iron supplement products. KV subsidiary Ther-Rx-Corp., also recalled its prescription prenatal vitamins and prescription iron supplements.
In addition to the recalls, KV acknowledged in its Jan. 26 news release that it is facing a "series of putative class action shareholder lawsuits alleging violations of the federal securities laws by the company," as well as an informal inquiry by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

U.S. drug manufacturer recalls millions of acetaminophen pills

A major U.S. manufacturer of acetaminophen sold by Wal-Mart, CVS, Safeway and more than 100 other retailers recalled 11 million bottles of the widely used pain-relieving pills Thursday after discovering some were contaminated with metal fragments.
There were no immediate reports of injuries or illness. The recall affects bottles containing various amounts of 500-milligram caplets made by the Perrigo Co.
The contaminated pills included metal fragments ranging in size from "microdots" to portions of wire one-third of an inch long(.846 centimeters), the Food and Drug Administration said. Perrigo discovered the metal bits during quality-control checks after realizing the equipment it uses to make pills was wearing down prematurely, the FDA said.
A company investigation turned up metal in roughly 200 pills, after passing 70 million of the caplets through a metal detector, according to the FDA.
Consumers who swallow any of the contaminated pills could suffer minor stomach discomfort or possible cuts to the mouth and throat, the FDA said, adding that the risk of serious injury was remote. Anyone who suspects they have been injured should contact a doctor, the agency said.
The FDA posted on its Web site the recalled batch numbers and the dozens of chains supplied by Perrigo, which bills itself as the world's largest manufacturer of store-brand nonprescription drugs. The 129 retailers that could potentially be affected by the recall include Wal-Mart Stores Inc., CVS Corp., Safeway Stores and SuperValu Inc. They typically sell the Perrigo-made pills under private labels.
Perrigo said the pills contained raw material purchased from a third-party supplier and affected 383 batches. A company spokesman did not immediately return a call seeking comment.
Acetaminophen is best known as the drug in products sold under the Tylenol brand, but is widely available in generic versions. The drug, along with aspirin and ibuprofen, is one of the most widely used pain relievers available without a doctor's note. The retail market for the pain-relievers is worth more than $2 billion (euro1.5 billion) a year, according to Perrigo.
The recall does not affect Tylenol. The recall should not cause a shortage of acetaminophen, the FDA said.
The voluntary recall is considered a Class II recall since it covers products that might cause a temporary health problem or pose only a slight threat of a serious nature, according to the FDA.
Customers can check whether products they bought are being recalled by checking the store list on the FDA Web site, http://www.fda.gov/oc/po/firmrecalls/perrigo/perrigocustlist.html, and the batch list,            http://www.fda.gov/oc/po/firmrecalls/perrigo/perrigobatchlist.ht l.
The batch numbers appear on the container's label.

Midwest Heart Specialists Electronically Slashes Drug-Recall Response Time; Timely Warning Puts At-Risk Patient in the Right Place at the Right Time

Robert Fraser, 70, still shakes his head at the unusual sequence of events he credits for saving his life. 
    It's ironic, he says, that a Food and Drug Administration announcement withdrawing the diabetes drug, Rezulin*, from the market because of a risk of liver damage, prompted a phone call from his cardiologist's office.  The caller from Midwest Heart Specialists explained that a computer search of the group's electronic medical records had red-flagged his chart because Rezulin was listed as one of his prescription medications.  After reassuring him that the recall had nothing to do with the drugs he takes to manage his chronic heart failure, Fraser was asked to contact his primary care physician as soon as possible to discuss his diabetes treatment. 
    Fraser made an appointment for 1:30 that afternoon with his internist, David Kraman, M.D., Elmhurst.  During the office visit, Fraser said that although he had experienced periods of mild-to-moderate chest pain for about two weeks, he shrugged them off, because rest brought relief.  Dr. Kraman immediately sent him to Elmhurst Memorial Hospital for an emergency stent-angioplasty performed by Midwest Heart Specialists cardiologist Lawrence Barr, M.D. 
    "Now the angina is gone, and I feel like a new man," enthuses Fraser. "Luckily Midwest Heart Specialists called me, because otherwise I wouldn't have been in Dr. Kraman's office that day." 
    Phone calls were also made to nearly 300 other Midwest Heart Specialists patients on Rezulin, and follow-up letters were sent to their primary care physicians. 
Although the domino effect of the call to Fraser is unlikely to ever again be repeated, his story underscores a technological capability unmatched by any other physician group in the area. 
    Midwest Heart Specialists pioneered the use of wireless computing in a clinical setting, an initiative that brought national recognition by the Smithsonian Institution last year.  Physicians carry wireless hand-held computers to record their patients' health history, which is stored in a confidentiality-protected database that can readily retrieve patient-sensitive information.  So, just as in the case of the Rezulin recall, if another drug or treatment is found to have adverse side effects, the group's electronic medical record system can electronically sift through thousands of medical records at digital speed, and within minutes, identify the names of patient potentially at risk.  A similar search through traditional paper charts could easily take days and even weeks. 
    "It's not even feasible; most primary care physicians do not have the time or personnel to do a manual search," says Dr. Kraman.  "We tend to rely on TV, radio and newspaper reports to alert patients to drug recalls and warnings. Having Midwest Heart Specialists offer this service to their patients is tremendously valuable." 
    Rezulin was one of two drug recalls in as many months.  In February, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned physicians that the nighttime heartburn drug, Propulsid**, may cause fatal heart rhythms.  Midwest Heart Specialists identified 283 patients with prescriptions for the drug, and notified them and their physicians of the danger in a single day. 
    Midwest Heart Specialists is a physician practice of 33 board-certified cardiovascular specialists with four clinical offices in Naperville, Winfield, Downers Grove and Elmhurst, and four satellite offices in Yorkville, Bolingbrook, Sycamore and Sandwich.
 * Rezulin (troglitazone) went on the market in 1997, and was widely used to treat type 2, or adult onset, diabetes. It works by restoring the body's sensitively to the insulin, a hormone needed to process sugar in the blood. The drug was taken off the market in March, after the FDA reported there were at least 61 patient deaths due to liver failure associated with its use. 
    ** Propulsid (cisapride) is used to treat heartburn for acid reflux disease, a condition caused by a backflow of stomach acid into the esophagus. The drug hastens the movement of liquid and solid food through the digestive tract, reducing the likelihood of heartburn.  The FDA warns that people with certain disorders -- such as congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, advanced cancer and electrolyte problems -- should not take the drug.  Propulsid may cause serious interactions with other medications, including certain antibiotics, antidepressants, antifungals and protease inhibitors.

Germany's Bayer completes drug recall raising questions on European patient protection

German drugmaker Bayer AG said Thursday it has decided to withdraw its anti-cholesterol drug Baycol in Japan, the last market where it had remained available after being pulled elsewhere earlier this month.
The company said in a statement that the move would reduce its 2001 operating profit by up to $137 million. The wider withdrawal of Baycol, Bayer's No. 3 selling drug, already was expected to hurt the company's earnings for years.
Baycol, marketed as Lipobay in many parts of the world, was withdrawn everywhere except Japan on Aug. 8 after it was linked to 52 deaths worldwide. The company faces a growing raft of lawsuits on behalf of patients, with claims filed in at least four U.S. states and in France.
Bayer insists the claims are "groundless" and that it worked closely with regulators on both sides of the Atlantic. But the recall has cast a harsh light on the European Union's complex, overlapping system for licensing drugs and monitoring their safety.
Bayer voluntarily pulled the drug after increasing reports of side effects of muscular weakness, or rhabdomyolysis, especially in patients being simultaneously treated with another drug called gemfibrozil.
Suspected cases of rhabdomyolysis, which can lead to kidney failure, have been detected in more than 1,100 patients treated with Baycol worldwide, Bayer said Thursday.
Product information has long warned against taking Baycol and gemfibrozil concurrently, and Bayer strengthened its warning in the United States in 1999 after reports of side effects showed doctors there were prescribing some patients with both.
The same precaution was taken in the EU in June after Bayer submitted a new report to the British regulator who first licensed Baycol in 1997. Licenses issued for one EU country generally are adopted by the others.
But in the absence of any EU-wide equivalent to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, national authorities also are responsible for drug safety.
German Health Minister Ulla Schmidt repeated Thursday a complaint that Bayer sent German authorities the data behind the stiffer British warning only after the withdrawal was announced, despite rules stating that such findings be passed on within 15 days.
Bayer's information policy in the matter was "totally unacceptable," Schmidt's deputy, Klaus Theo Schroeder, said last week.
The lapse highlighted the need for tighter national and international laws to detect risks earlier, Schroeder said, though officials have stopped short of saying Germany would have tried to pull the drug earlier.
The company, on the other hand, insists "all substantial information" was in the hands of the German regulator in April and that Britain's Medicines Control Agency should have informed its counterparts across the continent.
"There are varying legal interpretations of how the information should be handled," Bayer spokesman Michael Diehl said. "In our view, the British were responsible for informing the others."
The MCA said it informed other regulators immediately about its June decision that a stiffer warning would suffice to protect patients. But it added in a statement that Bayer was required to tell the national authorities about any new information which "may influence the overall balance of the risks and benefits associated with that medicine."
Bayer's shares have dropped by about a quarter since it first announced the withdrawal. The company has pledged to slash thousands of jobs, cut costs and overhaul its pharmaceuticals strategy. Many analysts expect its drug unit to be folded into a joint venture with a rival or sold.
Bayer originally didn't withdraw the drug from the Japanese market since gemfibrozil isn't available there. But Bayer said Thursday it had been informed by the Japanese health authorities that gemfibrozil would soon be registered in Japan.
Bayer also cited the possibility that Japanese users of Baycol could travel abroad and come into contact with gemfibrozil. No deaths in Japan have been linked to the drug.
Last week, it said it would put off its debut on the New York Stock Exchange, set for Sept. 26, until early February.
On Thursday, the shares slipped again, losing 2 percent at 34.20 euros ($31.22) by late afternoon in Frankfurt.
