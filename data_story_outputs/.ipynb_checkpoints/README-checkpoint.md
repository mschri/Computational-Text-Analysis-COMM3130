## Blog post an of your data story and creative output for COMM3130 Group Data Project

* This folder should contain the files that contain the outputs of all your data analysis. 

1. You should create an engaging data blog that stands alone (i.e. it doesn't require the reader to look over all your analysis notebooks).
2. Your creative output that presents you data story/findings in an engaging way. This could be a video, poster, web application, data dashboard, board game, song, etc, etc.

* Update this README file to describe the content.

The creative output for this data story will be in the form of a blog. It will describe and re-imagine the findings from each section of the analysis (parts 1-2) and observations along the lines of a blog-post/narrative structure.
